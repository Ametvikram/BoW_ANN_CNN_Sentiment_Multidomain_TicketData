Jabra C150 Headset for 2.5mm Universal Headset Jack: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I owned one of these for about three months, then it started to fall apart.  It was $30 at Best Buy.  I haven't replaced it, as $30 is a *lot*.$10?  I'm buying two more.  I can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle, talking to someone, with no problems.  It has far better sound quality than my 'backup', which is a Jabra with no boom.  The ear volume is adjustable on my phone, and I'm wondering what phones other reviewers have that won't let them adjust the volume"
Jabra C150 Headset for 2.5mm Universal Headset Jack: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I've had my headset for about a month now.  As noted by another reviewer, this headset does not come with any buttons or switches - the only thing on the cord is a shirt clip.  6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears, which is nice (though I've only ever used one).  The headset is very easy to slip into my ear (only takes 1 second) and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear (at which point my ear starts to get a little sore).  My boyfriend reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels.  If you regularly stay on the phone longer than 2 hours, it's something to keep in mind.  However, it suits my needs just fine, and for the low price, I think it's really a great buy"
Jabra C150 Headset for 2.5mm Universal Headset Jack: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"The sound is great, and the sleak design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others.  The bud actually sits comfortably in my ear -- this is a first (and my neice used the extra buds for her MP3 player and loved them)."
Jabra EarWave Boom with Universal 2.5mm connector: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"The device works fine and I don't feel I over paid.  Sure there are better hands free devices out there, but this one is reliable. "
Jabra EarWave Boom with Universal 2.5mm connector: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,My perception is that the headset is very confortable to use and the clarity of my voice is fine.I use the headset all day without any discomfort. I higly recommend it over the other types of headset
Jabra EarBoom for phones with Universal 2.5mm Jack: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"i helped develop the danger hiptop (aka ""t-mobile sidekick) and hated holding its brick-like nature to my head ... i wanted a good headset ...the only problem is i *hate* earbuds, so i wasn't looking forward to shopping for/buying one.  i went to the local super-electronics store, and abusing their return policy, bought one of every headset they had to try -- 23 headsets to be exact ... i picked up the jabra only to be a complete-ist, figuring there was no way i'd buy its star-trek-bugs-crawling-in-chekov's-ear styling.but after trying them all, the jabra was *easily* the best feeling and best fitting.  in a nutshell, here are the things i like about this unit in particular:* it comes with 6 different fittings (3 sizes for the right and the left), so you get a chance to get a *much* closer fit than some generic ear piece.* contrary to what others have said here, the ear pieces stay *very* snug in your ear (if they don't, you're not fitting them correctly).* i wear glasses, so i can't tolerate over-the-ear headsets.  this, of course, is great in that way.* i like having the model with the microphone boom over the classic ear-only jabra because it:  1. let's people know you're talking on the phone, and less likely to interrupt you while you're talking.  2. i drive a convertible and the mike cover is good enough that i can easily talk to people with the top down and be heard without a ton of wind noise.* it's small and easy to wrap up into my cell case.also in the newest version, they've adding a securing ""lip"" to the rubber ear pieces that keep them from falling off the ear piece (this definitely was a problem before).to top it all off, jabra's support is excellent.  i called their 800 number when my securing clip for my shirt broke and they immediately sent me *three* replacements, free of charge, along with a ball point pen for my ""troubles.""at 10 bucks, these things are a steal ... using one with my hiptop is a joy -- it means i can still contruct sms's, type in emails, add messages and addresses to my address book whilst talking on the phone.  if you have a data device of any kind, this will make your phone experience twice as good.a truly great product from a company that knows how to treat its customers right.  what more could you want?thanks for reading"
Jabra EarBoom for phones with Universal 2.5mm Jack: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I think this is a pretty good earpiece...  granted, I've only used one other (it was a flimsy little thing that came w/ my friend's Nokia), but this one far surpasses that one in sound quality and comfort.  Where my friend's would fall out of my ear, this one (once I got it figured out) never comes loose.    Second, listening to people on my friend's, I would have to turn up the sound to hear the person well, and then they sounded muffled and distorted; but on my Jabra I can actually turn down the volume on my phone and they sound crisp and clear-- moreso than when I'm not using the earpiece.  Finally, when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece, she sounds distant and muffled; I've had no complaints from the people I'm talking to using the Jabra, and, in fact, my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I don't.The ear gels are a bit hard to get used to.  They are oddly shaped (as you can see in the picture), and there are six of them total-- three of them for each ear.  Lots of reviewers complained about the fit and comfort of the ear gels, while others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces they've used and that they fit perfectly...  I can honesly say I've had both experiences.  When I first got this unit the earpiece kept falling out everytime that I would turn my head: *very* frustrating.  I tried pushing it into my ear as hard as I could, I tried holding it in place with my hand, but that only seemed to defeat the purpose of having a hands-free earpiece.  Nothing seemed to work.  I was thinking of returning it.  I was thinking of throwing it into traffic on I-95.  And then one day, somehow, I came to the realization that you have to sort of twist it into your ear-- with the little poky-out part stuck in the fold of your ear next to the ear canal (not the fold on the top of your ear; if you do that it'll just pop out again)-- and then *voila* it stays put.  Matter o' fact, it'll stay put so well that it'll be a little bit difficult-- even *painful*-- to get out again.I can imagine that people with different ear sizes, different patience levels, and lower IQs might have different experiences than my own.  But all I can say is that once I had this little bugger figured out, I was golden.  I love this thing and almost never talk on the phone without it.Admittedly, it is a bit difficult to get into your ear-- I'd say it takes upward of 2 seconds to get in properly (before you're good and practiced at it), which may not sound like a lot, but it's long enough to not recognize somebody's voice or hear the first sentence they say, or whatever.  A *very mild* frustration.  But like all things good and pleasant, it takes a little practice to get it just right and now I have it so that I can answer the phone, slip the EarBoom in my ear and start a conversation without missing a beat.  In fact, I find this earpiece to be so comfortable that I forget that it's in until I go to scratch my ear or something!The other complaint that I saw on here was that it's not compatible with Nokia phones.  In fact, it even says right on the package that it's not compatible with Nokia.  That's funny, I have a Nokia 3589i and it works just fine.  They make two other models of EarBoom (one of which clearly would not have worked with my phone), both of which claim to be Nokia compatible, and *neither* of those works with my phone!  Confusing?  Yes!  The problem is it doesn't work with *all* Nokia phones.  While browsing at the store I noticed that the ones that claimed to be Nokia compatible had a list of phones that it works with, but it didn't include mine (it included one that was, numerically speaking, very close to my model: the 3590); which piqued my curiosity.  And so I went to the friendly manager of the store that I was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and let me test both of them.  One of them worked, the other didn't.  The strange part of it was that we couldn't see a visible difference in the two units...  and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it (that's this one, and if you look closely at the picture you can see them), while the other one (the one marked as Nokia compatible) had three.  Hmmm...  Curious.So my advice is to either know your phone well (as in, have the little book handy) or ask for help before purchasing.All in all 4 of 5 stars.  I'd give it 5 stars on performance and comfort, but have to take it down a notch for an extended period of getting used to it and for confusing packaging.Addendum:Several months later the little piece of foam has fallen from the end of the boom so that any sound from the wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other end...  And living in windy Providence, this is a bit of an annoyance.Also, for a while I was having a problem where the earpiece would cut out for seconds at a time so that I couldn't hear the person on the other end of the line (and, likewise, they couldn't hear me) unless I jiggled the little jack.  This was *very *FRUSTRATING.**  Now, for some reason, I'm not having that problem anymore.  I'm not really sure if the problem was due to my phone or the EarBoom.  Either way, it's something buyers should be aware of"
Jabra EarBoom for phones with Universal 2.5mm Jack: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"So I bought this thing based on the Amazon reviews and saved a bundle over the local retail cost (yeah Amazon!), but that's not why I'm writing this review.I'd like to talk about the performance and comfort of the Earboom.  The eargel thingies are designed quite well, of the three different sizes for each ear you're bound to find one that fits very comfortably.  Turns out I couldn't find any that fit my right ear comfortably for extended periods of use but found a perfect fit in my mate on the other side.  My wife had the exact opposite experience - hopefully our daughter will inherit more symmetrical ears!  I hate jogging so can't comment on the fit during that activity but can say the gels fit suprising well in the folds of your ear and the boom is quite secure when installed.  I'd have to imagine it'd take a big hit to knock it loose once in place.Sound quality from the earbud is decent, but I feel the Earboom lacks some fidelity, especially the higher frequencies.  Normally this is not a problem, but it can sometimes make the person you're talking to sound like Isaac Hayes.  The speaker is plently loud and the lack of high frequencies allows you to tune into the tonal range where us humans tend to converse, without having the voices washed over with background noise.  The gels block an appropriate amount of external sounds allowing you to concentrate on the discussion at hand without impeding your ability to hear say an ambulance while driving.  There is a small slot on the gels that funnels some external noise to your drum, while the rest of the gel fits snug to the ear blocking out other stray noise paths.I've asked people how I sound and thus far the feedback has been positive, my voice comes through loud and clear despite the boom's apparent lack of length, reinforcing my belief that size DOESN'T matter.  In fact, I have found the mic to be very sensitive to even small sounds.  Forget talking on the phone and subtly typing on the keyboard our mouse click surfing - they'll hear every click.  Another example, I was in my house and the person on the other end could hear the kids playing in the pool 40 feet away with the house windows closed!!  Yes, the mic is that sensitive.  Even while driving they could hear when I shifted gears.  Not that it's obtrusive to the other person on the phone, it's just good to be aware they can hear it all.What more to say about such a simple device. Form Fit and Function are all there and I would recommend this product.  In fact, I just ordered another - it makes a great gift"
Jabra EarBoom for phones with Universal 2.5mm Jack: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in BOLD letters-within the title-it says ""Universal 2.5mm Jack""  Universal meaning ALL 2.5mm jacks. Not all cell phones.  Know your phone and your aquisition before giving a bad review.  Great product"
Samsung t809 Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I've been using my T809 since January and mostly love it.  Three main problems:  1) There is some sort of pinhole leak in the upper right corner of the screen where dust gets in behind the screen lens.  Looks like crap when the display is inactive.  I've read that other people have this problem too.  2) I hardly ever use this as an MP3 player because you have to use their poorly designed headset (they won't stay in my ears!) and because you can't hear the phone ring over the headset while listening to music.3) The ring starts off softly and builds to a louder volume.  If I have the phone in my pocket I miss the first couple of rings (too quiet) and by the time I realize I'm getting a call and fumble to get it out of my pocket, I've usually missed the call.  This sucks and I don't think there's a setting to disable this ""feature"".It's close to ideal, but no cigar.  Camera's great, reception's great, easy to use.  But I'll probably look for something similar but better after my contract expires.BTW, if you get insurance thru TMobile for any phone, make sure you see it on the bill.  I had a problem with water damage three weeks after buying.   TMobile claimed I never asked for insurance, but fortunately Amazon exchanged it."
Samsung t809 Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,Ive always stayed away from the flip/slider phones because Im good at breaking things...Ive had this one for almost six months and its still going strong.  The mini sd port is awesome
Samsung t809 Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"The phone is great. You can check all the specs online and in other posts. You'll see that they're awesome.From my experience...Pros: - lots of features- Slick phone... I do care about how my gadgets look like.- camera resolution is pretty good.Cons:- hard to find a good case. I'm still looking for a good one. The one I got, my phone will slip out of it once in a while.- If you have a BMW and want to bluetooth with it, fugget'boutit.... Althought it's not really the phone's fault, but BMW's (as I've read on other msg boards), it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to hook up my new phone to my new BMW..."
Plantronics M60 Over The Ear Headset w/ 2.5mm Plug: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone.  It has more than enough volume.  It comes with both a right and left ear adapter.  Fits pretty good and I have medium sized ears. Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it.  It is very comfortable though. If you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset.
"Premium Vehicle Power Charger for Motorola RAZR V3, KRZR, SLVR, PEBL, and Q Phone: Cell Phones & Service",4.0,if you do not know the best thing about this ophone then that may be the reason that you are looking at this silly thing!!! don't bye this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that??!!! everyone should know that the best thing about the razors telephone is that the telephone that is a razor does not have a chiord on it!!! why would you by a chord for a telephone that is so great because it doesn;t have a chord. jeez!
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"Are you kidding me?  We're going to set up an EarGel Xchange?  Will this be domestic, the Americas or are we going Enter-Gnashin-All with this PUPPY?!?Ok, I'll do the web site, we're going to need some fat pipe to handle the bandwidth for this one.  Anyone know a Fortune 500 CEO we can bring into the picture?  Distribution is going to be biggest problem here, I'm thinking we don't give UPS a look, let's hit up DHL with an agreement they expand into territories when volume dictates.  It's gamble, but if we can drive down the shipping cost it should keep those 'Johnny Gels come lately' from jumping into arena.I'll go ahead and have a talk with some of the other players in the community, I've got a 5 year no-compete signed with Craigs List but eBay is busting my b???s over this, they want 9% of the gross ad revenue from www.UnlovedEarGels.com but after we secure the venture capital I'll tell those jokers to take a hike.Allright, let's get this thing moving folks great ideas have a shelf-life and the clock is ticking"
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"These are very good and not expensive.You buy these at Staples and they charge $5 more.I agree that a public exchange is needed. If anyone knows of one, can you please post that information here. We'll all appreciate it!Anybody want to trade the extras"
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"These work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking, say in a grocery store. Of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound, but they're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping. The only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use. Taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying"
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I love these eargels.  My ears are a funny shape and I can't wear regular earbuds, but when I add these gels, they fit great and don't fall out.  They block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds.  Sometimes I need a Small, and sometimes I need a Medium, depending on the day, the weather, and how long I use them.  (I gave the Large size to my boss, and he loves them too, so don't say you can't use all of the sizes, guys."
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I agree it's a waste to get sizes you don't need. Here's an idea to do a public exchange. I do not need the large and medium, and will be glad to give to anyone, just for the postage. I just need the small sizes."
Motorola RAZR V3 Magenta Pink Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I recently got this phone and love it.  T-mobile's service may not be the best, but I have had no problems with the phone itself.  For all the people saying that it isn't really magenta-It is.  The pink razr offered by Cingular is a pale pink, the t-mobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown.  I looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have different shades"
Motorola RAZR V3 Magenta Pink Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Having had every new gadget imaginable I must report that I LOVE this phone because I can take pictures and make videos! I LOATHE having to charge the battery everyday! Perhaps I just got a bad battery but I've NEVER had to charge any phone daily. Keep in mind that I leave my phone on 24/7. Maybe I should turn it off. Does anyone else have this same syndrome? If you're a shutterbug like me, you will love this phone. I didn't even mention the hot pink/magenta color which all gals love. One note of caution, If you live in hurricane alley like me, you may want to carry a spare battery just in case they don't take down the cell phone towers before the storm. It may be useless locally but you can at least tell your people you're still among the living and need money to escape the carnage"
Motorola RAZR V3 Magenta Pink Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I have a T-Mobile Magenta Razr and have for the past 6 months. I love it. In fact when I had issues with my first one, T-Mobile replaced it. They have great customer service! This phone is top of the line from its huge screen to its bluetooth technology. And I love the color cause it sticks out everywhere. They should make more phones in fun BRIGHT colors like this. I personally don't mind the supposedly tedious software. Of course I will admit that I liked the Motorola software so much with my first phone that I stuck with the brand for this phone. It is so easy I figured it out without really picking up the manual.  Overally I will continue to stick w/T-Mobile and Motorola for as long as I keep needing a cellphone"
Motorola RAZR V3 Magenta Pink Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,I purchased the pink razr with Cingular service and couldn't be happier. I have had it for about a month and have had no problems at all. I am very happy with it. T-mobile is not a very good service in my opinion and that is why I chose Cingular

Jabra EarBoom for phones with Universal 2.5mm Jack: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in BOLD letters-within the title-it says ""Universal 2.5mm Jack""  Universal meaning ALL 2.5mm jacks. Not all cell phones.  Know your phone and your aquisition before giving a bad review.  Great product"
Samsung t809 Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I've been using my T809 since January and mostly love it.  Three main problems:  1) There is some sort of pinhole leak in the upper right corner of the screen where dust gets in behind the screen lens.  Looks like crap when the display is inactive.  I've read that other people have this problem too.  2) I hardly ever use this as an MP3 player because you have to use their poorly designed headset (they won't stay in my ears!) and because you can't hear the phone ring over the headset while listening to music.3) The ring starts off softly and builds to a louder volume.  If I have the phone in my pocket I miss the first couple of rings (too quiet) and by the time I realize I'm getting a call and fumble to get it out of my pocket, I've usually missed the call.  This sucks and I don't think there's a setting to disable this ""feature"".It's close to ideal, but no cigar.  Camera's great, reception's great, easy to use.  But I'll probably look for something similar but better after my contract expires.BTW, if you get insurance thru TMobile for any phone, make sure you see it on the bill.  I had a problem with water damage three weeks after buying.   TMobile claimed I never asked for insurance, but fortunately Amazon exchanged it."
Samsung t809 Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,Ive always stayed away from the flip/slider phones because Im good at breaking things...Ive had this one for almost six months and its still going strong.  The mini sd port is awesome
Samsung t809 Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"The phone is great. You can check all the specs online and in other posts. You'll see that they're awesome.From my experience...Pros: - lots of features- Slick phone... I do care about how my gadgets look like.- camera resolution is pretty good.Cons:- hard to find a good case. I'm still looking for a good one. The one I got, my phone will slip out of it once in a while.- If you have a BMW and want to bluetooth with it, fugget'boutit.... Althought it's not really the phone's fault, but BMW's (as I've read on other msg boards), it was quite frustrating for me when I tried to hook up my new phone to my new BMW..."
Jabra C150 Headset for 2.5mm Universal Headset Jack: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I owned one of these for about three months, then it started to fall apart.  It was $30 at Best Buy.  I haven't replaced it, as $30 is a *lot*.$10?  I'm buying two more.  I can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle, talking to someone, with no problems.  It has far better sound quality than my 'backup', which is a Jabra with no boom.  The ear volume is adjustable on my phone, and I'm wondering what phones other reviewers have that won't let them adjust the volume"
Jabra C150 Headset for 2.5mm Universal Headset Jack: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I've had my headset for about a month now.  As noted by another reviewer, this headset does not come with any buttons or switches - the only thing on the cord is a shirt clip.  6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears, which is nice (though I've only ever used one).  The headset is very easy to slip into my ear (only takes 1 second) and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear (at which point my ear starts to get a little sore).  My boyfriend reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels.  If you regularly stay on the phone longer than 2 hours, it's something to keep in mind.  However, it suits my needs just fine, and for the low price, I think it's really a great buy"
Jabra C150 Headset for 2.5mm Universal Headset Jack: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"The sound is great, and the sleak design and lack of bells and whistles gives me hope that this headset might last a bit longer than others.  The bud actually sits comfortably in my ear -- this is a first (and my neice used the extra buds for her MP3 player and loved them)."
Plantronics M60 Over The Ear Headset w/ 2.5mm Plug: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone.  It has more than enough volume.  It comes with both a right and left ear adapter.  Fits pretty good and I have medium sized ears. Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it.  It is very comfortable though. If you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset.
"Premium Vehicle Power Charger for Motorola RAZR V3, KRZR, SLVR, PEBL, and Q Phone: Cell Phones & Service",4.0,if you do not know the best thing about this ophone then that may be the reason that you are looking at this silly thing!!! don't bye this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that??!!! everyone should know that the best thing about the razors telephone is that the telephone that is a razor does not have a chiord on it!!! why would you by a chord for a telephone that is so great because it doesn;t have a chord. jeez!
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"Are you kidding me?  We're going to set up an EarGel Xchange?  Will this be domestic, the Americas or are we going Enter-Gnashin-All with this PUPPY?!?Ok, I'll do the web site, we're going to need some fat pipe to handle the bandwidth for this one.  Anyone know a Fortune 500 CEO we can bring into the picture?  Distribution is going to be biggest problem here, I'm thinking we don't give UPS a look, let's hit up DHL with an agreement they expand into territories when volume dictates.  It's gamble, but if we can drive down the shipping cost it should keep those 'Johnny Gels come lately' from jumping into arena.I'll go ahead and have a talk with some of the other players in the community, I've got a 5 year no-compete signed with Craigs List but eBay is busting my b???s over this, they want 9% of the gross ad revenue from www.UnlovedEarGels.com but after we secure the venture capital I'll tell those jokers to take a hike.Allright, let's get this thing moving folks great ideas have a shelf-life and the clock is ticking"
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"These are very good and not expensive.You buy these at Staples and they charge $5 more.I agree that a public exchange is needed. If anyone knows of one, can you please post that information here. We'll all appreciate it!Anybody want to trade the extras"
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"These work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking, say in a grocery store. Of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound, but they're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping. The only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use. Taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying"
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I love these eargels.  My ears are a funny shape and I can't wear regular earbuds, but when I add these gels, they fit great and don't fall out.  They block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds.  Sometimes I need a Small, and sometimes I need a Medium, depending on the day, the weather, and how long I use them.  (I gave the Large size to my boss, and he loves them too, so don't say you can't use all of the sizes, guys."
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I agree it's a waste to get sizes you don't need. Here's an idea to do a public exchange. I do not need the large and medium, and will be glad to give to anyone, just for the postage. I just need the small sizes."
Motorola RAZR V3 Magenta Pink Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I recently got this phone and love it.  T-mobile's service may not be the best, but I have had no problems with the phone itself.  For all the people saying that it isn't really magenta-It is.  The pink razr offered by Cingular is a pale pink, the t-mobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown.  I looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have different shades"
Motorola RAZR V3 Magenta Pink Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Having had every new gadget imaginable I must report that I LOVE this phone because I can take pictures and make videos! I LOATHE having to charge the battery everyday! Perhaps I just got a bad battery but I've NEVER had to charge any phone daily. Keep in mind that I leave my phone on 24/7. Maybe I should turn it off. Does anyone else have this same syndrome? If you're a shutterbug like me, you will love this phone. I didn't even mention the hot pink/magenta color which all gals love. One note of caution, If you live in hurricane alley like me, you may want to carry a spare battery just in case they don't take down the cell phone towers before the storm. It may be useless locally but you can at least tell your people you're still among the living and need money to escape the carnage"
Motorola RAZR V3 Magenta Pink Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I have a T-Mobile Magenta Razr and have for the past 6 months. I love it. In fact when I had issues with my first one, T-Mobile replaced it. They have great customer service! This phone is top of the line from its huge screen to its bluetooth technology. And I love the color cause it sticks out everywhere. They should make more phones in fun BRIGHT colors like this. I personally don't mind the supposedly tedious software. Of course I will admit that I liked the Motorola software so much with my first phone that I stuck with the brand for this phone. It is so easy I figured it out without really picking up the manual.  Overally I will continue to stick w/T-Mobile and Motorola for as long as I keep needing a cellphone"
Motorola RAZR V3 Magenta Pink Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,I purchased the pink razr with Cingular service and couldn't be happier. I have had it for about a month and have had no problems at all. I am very happy with it. T-mobile is not a very good service in my opinion and that is why I chose Cingular
RED PROGUARD COVER SNAP-ON CASE for MOTOROLA RAZR / V3 / V3c / V3m: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,Love it.  Sort of a metallic red with a soft touch rubber feel.  Some of the soft touch is coming off at the corners with wear but it's still red which is nice.  I will probably get another color on it for spring.  The fit is so snug on the phone that ppl actually ask me where I got my razr since the Sprint red is a little different.  Also maintains all openings for data cables etc
RED PROGUARD COVER SNAP-ON CASE for MOTOROLA RAZR / V3 / V3c / V3m: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,Absolutely loved this snap on cover for my new motorola razr v3m.  Fits perfectly. 
Body Glove Scuba II Cellsuit for Motorola i860 - Black/Blue: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I have had this for almost 6 months and I like it a lot.  Right off, it looks great.  Black leather, blue piping going around the edge.  The blue is that vivid color that one of those exotic/expensive fish tank fish have:  neons or tetras?  Whichever it is, it is very sharp looking.I keep i860 cell phone in the 'Glove all the time.  It does not add much bulk/size/weight to the phone.  It fits it, after all, like a glove.When I am taking a photo, I simply unsnap the half that is on the flip-up half of my cell phone which is where the camera lens is, take the photo, and slip it back on.  Before I used to know about this, I used to press down a little strap on it that would get in the way, like a wayward lock of hair.  Turns out that futzing with the strap is unnecessary.  They designed it so you can just remove that half of the case, take photo(s), and snap it back on.  Smart.In fact, the reason the strap is there in the first place is so you can easily remove the other half.  Look what is on the end of that strap before you curse it, guys.   It's a snap!  Snaps unsnap; that is what they are for.The glove is well named.  It makes the phone much easier to grip in your hand.  I can easily pivot it around in my hand, flip it around, pick it up, and basically not expect it to skid around.  Without the 'Glove, you have a bare metal or plastic case.  Smooth looking and - well, maybe too smooth for something small and costing hundreds of dollars!I like the fast release for the belt hook.  So far, it has not failed me.  I think it is at the bottom, not at the back the way some people have said, but I cannot remember for certain. I know it goes off and on easily for me but has never come off on its own yet.I don't use it that way much though.  The i860 is not much bigger than one of those little matchbox cars from the 1960s. I easily fit it in my pocket.  With the glove on, I know it is probably not going to get scratched too easily"
Aluminium Case for Sprint PPC-6700//Verizon VX6700/HTC Apache Ext. Batt. Version (Black): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This protects my PPC 6700 wonderfully... I've dropped it many times and this case protected it like I wanted... No scratches, nothing... Having room for the extended battery is great too, because the extended battery adds hours and hours too the life of my phone"
Xcite Cell Phone Multi-Color Music Note Charm: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Was received in a timely manner, however, the picture online was not what I expected.  For the price, I really thought it was a little cheap looking in person.  As it was a gift, I was somewhat disappointed in the quality.  However, the person I gave it to was pleased"
New OEM Blackberry 8100 8100c Pearl Stereo Headset: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"This headseat is pretty neat when you're on the road or just relaxing between work.  It easily switches from media player to handsfree headset when you get a call and also controls the pause/play and answer/hangup features.  The comfort of the ear budds could be a little better, but the stereo sound is great"

BlackBerry 7100 Series Leather Pouch - Black: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,This is a great product. The only area of improvement would be the belt clip. It is very difficult to attach to the belt. Over all it is a great case
Nokia N73 Silver Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I Really like this phone, the camera quality, the software, everything is excellent"
Nokia N73 Silver Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This is really cool phone and has many features. Unfortunately, you could not use some of these features in the U.S. One thing I do not understand why unlocked phones are so expensive in the US and retailers charge much more price. Its price is just 429.99 on the Nokia's web page.The phone gets 5 stars but the retailer's price gets -2 stars."
Nokia N73 Silver Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,I will keep this short and to the point this is the best phone I have ever owned.Its great for taking pictures the pictures come out so clear
Nokia N73 Silver Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"Just received it this week.  Replacing my Nokia N90 with this model, the photos are much better (both have optical Carl Zeiss lenses, but this is 3.2 mp vs. 2.0 on the N90).  Also, the N73 covers all radio bands, making the reception on my Cingular coverage very very strong everywhere (supposedly two internal antennae).  The N90 lacked one of the frequency ranges used by Cingular, so depending on the city I was in, I occasionally had very spotty coverage.  The Symbian operating system in the N73 is faster than the older version on the N90, and best of all, it is much more compact than the N90, fits nicely in the palm of my hand and in my jeans pocket.  Last, there is a very smooth operating lense cover on the back of the phone, protecting the camera lense (why aren't they all like this?).  As usual, the flash isn't the equivalent of even a moderate digital camera, but otherwise I see this phone as the best of both worlds. "
Samsung A820 Prepaid Phone (STi Mobile) : Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"If you don't use this phone, it costs $3/month.  Normal hours til 9 p.m. it's 12 cents per minute, which is a bit less than half of what most prepaid phones cost.  Perfect for my occasional use and for locating family members when I'm in transit and feel that I simply must know where they are and what they are doing.  I don't use cell phones much, but if I must have one, I might as well have one that doesn't make me worry about another huge bill.  For kids who think they can mangle the budget, forget it cuz when the card is used up -- that's it kiddo.  Once they use up the card, the only number they can dial is 911, but that's it.  Bonus features: clock is always accurate and it has a great alarm which tells me when to get up to go to work and another to tell me when to go home at the end of the day.  At some point, I might not be able to live without this. "
Palm Treo 650 JAVOScreen Anti Glare Screen Protector (3-Pack): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything you've normally seen.  Typically, 95% of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen, hope against hope that you don't have bubbles, but you almost always do. When the screen is off, you see the bubbles, thankfully when the screen is on, the bubbles are pretty invisible..... BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal.  They are thick, and tough, and relatively firm.  And because of those properties, they go on with NO bubbles, and they are easily moveable (adjustable) should you not get it on perfectly the first time.  Further, they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good.  This is the state of the art for screen protectors.  And this all becomes an even bigger issue for men, because of whiskers, over time the screen will get dulled and scratched.  Because of the thickness and quality of these, scratches to the screen are no longer an issue.   "
Motorola Razr V3 Swivel Belt Clip Holster - Black (Face Out): Cell Phones & Service,5.0, I was completely satisfied with the phone clip I purchased. It`s sturdy and well constructed. I would recommend it.I will use this site again
Motorola V171 Prepaid Phone (NET10): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,I HAVE HAD THIS MOTOROLA V171 FOR A YEAR NOW AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. THE FEATURES ARE SO EASY TO UNDERSTAND. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS FOR NET 10 WIRELESS ARE VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND. THIS PHONE IS A NET 10 WIRELESS PHONE. NET 10 WIRELESS IS A SUBSIDIARY OF TRACFONE.  I WOULD THIS PHONE TO ANYBODY LOOKING FOR A PREPAID CELL PHONE PLAN. I LOVE IT BECAUSE ONLY FOR A LIMITED TIME YOU GET 300 MINUTES FREE UPON ACTIVATION OF YOUR PHONE. I WOULD ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT IF ANYBODY PURCHASES THIS MOTOROLA ACTIVATE IT ON [...] ITS A WHOLE LOT EASIER THAN CALLING
Motorola V171 Prepaid Phone (NET10): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I've been using this phone with the Net10 service since March, and have to say I am very happy with it.  Coverage areas have been great.I don't use a cell phone very often, so this was the most economical way for me to go. Although the phone doesn't have all the bells and whistles like other phones have....it gets the job done"
Motorola V171 Prepaid Phone (NET10): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I have not had any problems with this phone.I dont use it for long periods at a time ...only in the car and for text.Adding minutes is easy and i REALLY GET MY MONEYS WORTH WITH THE ROLLOVER.I averaged it at less than 10 bucks a month with 600 minutes to spare...so its great for me.I got better ringtones online and still waiting to see about wallpaper.Overall,I would recommend this phone if you dont need more than 100 minutes per week"
Motorola V171 Prepaid Phone (NET10): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I like this little flip phone.  The service has been good and the features are easy to use.  The only reason I give 4 stars is because I am not sure how long the phone will last.  The flip part is a little weak, but we will have to see.  It was really easy to add minutes, and you can do it right from your Net10 phone"
Silicon Skin Protective for PDA Palm Treo 650 700w 700p (9 Color to choose from for each model) (700p Purple): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be.  It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  I am going to buy another in a different color
Silicon Skin Protective for PDA Palm Treo 650 700w 700p (9 Color to choose from for each model) (700p Purple): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.  As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the ""thickness"" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.  "
Silicon Skin Protective for PDA Palm Treo 650 700w 700p (9 Color to choose from for each model) (700p Purple): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (GPS car holder), but does do what is was designed to do. Solid grip, and non-slip. Would be nice if it was not so thick"
Silicon Skin Protective for PDA Palm Treo 650 700w 700p (9 Color to choose from for each model) (700p Purple): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product."
Silicon Skin Protective for PDA Palm Treo 650 700w 700p (9 Color to choose from for each model) (700p Purple): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow"
Brand New LG Chocolate VX8500 Vehicle Power Charger with IC Chip: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"After buying the new LG Chocolate, I found that I needed to buy a new car charger for it. I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value. So far, it's worked just like it should"
Leather Case with Leather Wrapped Belt Clip for Nokia 1100: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"When I first got this, it did not look like it was big enough for my phone, but as soon as I opened the package and put my phone in it I could tell it was a perfect fit. I really like the clear window, which I did not have on my previous case, now I can see who is calling and answer my phone without having to take it out of the case every time"

RIM BlackBerry 8700g 8700c Leather Holster with Swivel Belt Clip. Black (ACC-10540-003): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,This is a great way to carry the blackberry.  It also keeps it protected.  I would recommend this product
Treo 650 SkinTight w/ Holster - Black: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Provides great protection for the Treo,but does add a noticeable amount of thickness,making it more of a bundle"
Treo 650 SkinTight w/ Holster - Black: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Overall, I like it.  The best part is the flip up screen protector.  I have had 2 Zire models and managed to break both screens.  My dislike is that I have had it for 4 months and it is no longer form fitting.  I have tried to get info on how to shrink it to be tight again, to no avail.  As for the SD card issue, I remedied that by carfully opening up the slot with an xacto blade to allow room for the card to clearly eject. To keep from having to take the skin off to reset my treo, I drilled a hole in the back, right through the battery cover to allow for easy resetting when my treo crashes"
Treo 650 SkinTight w/ Holster - Black: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"The skin is very useful, but can be improved on ways to put it on and take it off"
Treo 650 SkinTight w/ Holster - Black: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I'm not really a gadget guy, and what gadgets I do have get pretty beat up. When the company gave me a Treo 650 so I can ""stay in touch"", I needed to at least take care of the thing. So, I bought this skin from Speck Products. Its is absolutely awesome!No more dings or scratches. I'm a minimalist and for that, the Treo 650 Skin is perfect! A cool look, not bulky. Easy access to the buttons. They did their homework on this product. A must have for anyone who owns a Treo 650. I also see they have these for the Blackberries"

Samsung OEM Original Stereo Earbud Headset for Samsung SGH-D807/ SGH-T629/ SGH-T809 - AEP420SBEB/STD [Retail Package]: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,This item works perfectly with my Samsung Blackjack.  The sound quality is exceptional.  The only problem is that the clip to attach to your shirt tends to fall off
3 Piece Starter Kit for Motorola V220: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"When I bought my Motorola V220, my Cingular Store charged top dollar for the car charger - and they were sold out. I was thrilled when I found this starter set on Amazon.  The car charger is compatible with the V220, and it comes with case and hands-free ear bud - all for less than I would have paid for the charger alone.  The ear bud does not have the best sound - voices come across as somewhat muffled, though still audible - and the case is adequate.  I wouldn't buy this set specifically for those items, although they both work with/fit the V220.  As I see it, they were bonuses for purchasing the charger.Five stars for the charger, three for the rest"
Ratcheting Swivel Belt Holster for Nokia 1100: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This item was easy to find, purchase and use. Saved us several dollars as well. A true win-win. Thanks"
Insten - Retractable 2-in-1 Hotsync and Charging USB Cable for Tungsten T5/Treo 650: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"The product is compact and convenient, but it feels flimsy.  The hotsync function stopped working for a bit but was restored after I did a hard reset of my Palm TX--so it was not a cable problem but a problem with my TX.  For some reason, the cable won't let me charge using the USB wall-charger I got for my wife's iPod, but it does charge the TX off my computer's USB port (which is a Powerbook G4--notorious for being underpowered)"
Sanyo SCP-6600 Katana Cherry Blossom Phone (Sprint): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"Great reception, great volume controls, easy to use... I have the blue, my husband, the black... To the reviewer who said, ""too thin"" - well, don't get the thin phone then... Works great with his blue tooth and my jabra (plug in) - even comes with the adaptor for plug in phones... which other phone would most likely make you buy.  We're in our late 20s/early 30s - and just dig the phone.  Fits perfect in a small purse or wallet.  One issue DH has -- the antenna is right near the microphone you speak into (bottom of the phone) and when he is on speaker phone, he tends to hold it there, and it sometimes can make your bars go down.  That is it, and all you have to do is readjust the way you hold the phone"
Sanyo SCP-6600 Katana Cherry Blossom Phone (Sprint): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I really like this phone..  its cute, its little, its perfect for a young woman.  I had a pocket pc prior to this and it was so complicated just making a call.  I wanted something simple, that wasn't an mp3 player (i have an ipod), that wasn't a professional camera (i have a nice digital cam), or a pda (i have a palm tx)... its just simple and cute.its bluetooth compatible... although doesnt work that great with my bluetooth, but i'm not sure if its the headset or the phone..**the ringer on it is SUPER quiet... almost to the point you can barely hear it in your purse.  i'm grown accustomed to ""listening"" for the vibrate feature instead.i like how you can put a person's picture next to their name in your contact list.  i can wear it in the back pocket of my jeans and its comfortable.sound quality is good, on both endsi dig it.  im sure you will too"

Eforcity Clear Crystal Case for Motorola L6 / L2: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"The item by itself is perfect to protect the phone from Scratches, it fits like a glove , really nice , the delivery from Eforcity was really fast and well packed but it got cracked  after 5 days of use, it wasn't hit or treated carelessly. I'll order some more because they are really cheap and  it's better to have a cracked cover than a broken phone.Love how the phone looks in it while it was in good condition, the case started falling apart in cracked pieces and after 8 days I had to dump it."
Eforcity Clear Crystal Case for Motorola L6 / L2: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,Got this to protect my Motorola L6 phone.  It fits the phone like a glove.  I also love that it protects the phone screen.  The only complaint is that the case open easily if it's dropped or handled in a rough way.  Clear tape on the seams can easily take care of that.  My toddler has gotten a hold of my phone more than once and dropped it. The case still does not have a chip or crack on it

Palm Treo 600 Rapid Car Charger Adapter with IC Chip: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I have been buying these chargers from Sprint and they last about six-twelve months.

Nokia 5300 XpressMusic myFaves Black Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I recommend this phone to ANYBODY.  I absolutely love it.  I have had it for three months now and not a problem so far.  The music player is great, and I swear...the camera looks ALOT better than 1.3 mega pixel.  The handset is wonderful, and so is the headset included with it.  If you buy this phone, it WILL last you a long time.  But yeah..so far, no problems whatsoever.  I love it. [.."
Nokia 5300 XpressMusic myFaves Black Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I am in love...with my phone!  I know that sounds absurd, but it's true.  Originally, I had suggested a friend to upgrade their handset to getting this one; seeing how I had already done so with the Motorola V3T.  Ironically after being displeased with 2 different Motorola's V3T RAZR handsets (both for having them freeze at startup), I called customer service and told 'em I wanted this handset instead.  With a minor contract extension/handset upgrade, I was glad I made the switch to NOKIA.  I've only had it for 24 hours and I'm totally satisfied with it.  Below is a list of ""pro's and con's"" for you to consider:Pros:- Bright and visible LCD screen.- MP3-ringtones enabled (make sure to cut your tracks to about 25 seconds if doing so).- Video ringers.- Pretty fast charge, even while messing around with it.- Bluetooth and infrared-enabled making for quick file transfers.- Dialing keypad is raised for easy input.- Date can be enabled on screen (which the V3T lacks).- Comes with ""headphone jack adapter"" which enables use of any standard headphone that you may have.Cons:- Vibrate functionality is disabled with handset charges (by default).- Power button is somewhat small and difficult to execute.- FM radio plays with static (this may varies by area).As you can see, the pro's outweight the con's with this one, so give it at try.  Also, if you decide that it's not for you, return it to T-Mobile within 14 business days of your purchase and get a full refund.  As for me, I won't returning it because it's definitely a keeper!  :"
Nokia 5300 XpressMusic myFaves Black Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I purchased this phone to replace my land line and have not been disappointed.

Here are some pros and cons:Pros1-Colorful/Clear Display2-Good Volume (ringer volume is loud enough and I can hear callers just fine)3-Easy Menu NavigationCons1-No shortcut to get to main menu (have to keep pressing ""back"" button)2-Battery access (it's really hard to take the casing off to get to the battery and SIM card-could be a good thing though)3-On/Off Button (it's very small-basically have to use my fingernail)"
Nokia 5300 XpressMusic myFaves Black Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I got a chance to play with one of these last week. The external speaker is very loud, the controls are easy to use and best of all, it comes with a 1GB card. My only gripe is the slide feels a little loose; I felt like I was always going to open it up by mistake. All in all a killer phone and the MP3 capability/software is a lot better than my KRZR"
Nokia 5300 XpressMusic myFaves Black Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I purchased this Nokia 5300 Black at the T-Mobile store. It does come with 1 GB memory card and I was able to easily load up 160 songs last night with no problems. Phone comes with USB cable to connect to your computer. I have a Mac so this was easy to do. You will not be able to download songs bought from iTunes but you can load up AAC files and mp3 and mp4. You can hold up to 500 songs if they are all 3.5 minutes long and compressed to 128 kps. My music is usually remixed and/or longer than 3.5 minutes each.I wasn't able to sync up with Bluetooth to my iBook but I was able to pair with my Motorola T305 that I will be using in my car. Apple has not approved the Nokia 5300 yet to sync. I am sure it is a matter of time since the phone is rather new.Overall, I love the feel of this phone, has wonderful 2 in screen, color is great, camera is cool, and it is very intuitive to use. I have been with Samsung over the last three years and I was concerned about going back to a Nokia. However, the speakerphone is absolutely great compared to the Motorola 195 that I originally got but returned. Once you load up your songs, the speaker is impressive. This morning, I had the phone playing music in one part of the house, and I had to go get something at the other end of the house, and I could still hear the music perfectly.Calling on the phone was better than expected. I was talking to my friend during busy traffic and lots of people/background noise and I was able to carry on a pleasant conversation with her unlike my Samsung that was difficult to do this with.The phone is quite sturdy. And I am happy to have a phone that not everyone has - a Motorola Razor. This Nokia 5300 looks a bit chucky compared to that phone but I feel like I have a very unique phone that is more than a phone. Who needs an iPod mini when you can get this and your phone all in one?I just ordered the Boxwave Frost Case for this phone. There is very little to chose from at the T-Mobile store as far as accessories and Nokia.com didn't have much either.*****The alarm feature to wake up is cool too. You can choose to wake up to your favorite song that you have downloaded and you can program it to slowly increase the volume of the song for your alarm. It also comes with programmable snooze. What a dream!*****You can make calls without even having to slide the phone to dial. As long as you have the number you want already stored in your phone book, then all you have to do is look up and press the green button! *****When you are playing your music, if an incoming call comes in, it will stop playing the song and then alert you with the normal ring tone that a call is coming in. Once you are done with the phone call, you can resume playing your music.*****As I said, this phone is a gem in all areas - speaker, sturdy, colorful, I think it is contemporary and an acquired taste for sure but nonetheless appealing, call quality is great even in loud areas, and lots of little creature comforts.Definitely consider this phone if you really like to have music and bluetooth and speakerphone. Else, this may not be the phone for you"
Nokia 5300 XpressMusic myFaves Black Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I just purchased this phone four days ago and have been impressed with it for the most part. The first thing you'll notice is how crisp and clear the screen is.  This is a slider phone, and thankfully you can do most things without sliding the screen to expose the number keys. The only things that I can think of thus far that requires you to expose the keys is to dial a new number that's not in your contacts and to text message. Next, we go to the features.  So we got a 1.3MP camera, camcorder, music player, 1GB microSD card, bluetooth support, and infrared port..and *drumroll please* an FM radio.  Now, the FM radio isn't satellite based, so you cannot pick up radio stations from across the U.S., just those stations local to you.Now I will go into the good and bad things about each feature:1.  Camera - Impressive picture quality. Yes it's only 1.3MP compared to those 8MP digital cameras, but can you show me a camera that does what this phone does? 5/52.  Camcorder - Not all that impressive.  While you are recording, the quality seems perfect.  However, once you play it, it turns a bit distorted.  Plus, it only allows for 20 seconds of recording time regardless of the size of your microSD card. 3/53.  Music Player - Impressive.  The speaker is of good quality, and very loud.  However, I still could not find a way to change the order of the songs without making a playlist.  There's play, pause, next song, previous song, fast forward, and rewind features as buttons as shown in the pictures. The buttons must be pressed fairly hard, so your music won't start playing spontaneously in your pocket. Also, I was blown away on how the quality of the music improves once you put on those stock earbuds. 4/54. FM Radio - I bet those that have this phone tried to use the radio but stopped short and told you to buy an enhancement.  Well, the truth is you don't need to buy anything extra.  Just plug in the earbuds that came with the phone, and this will serve as an 'antenna' and will allow you to hear stations. And since you need the earbuds to hear the radio, yes the sound will go to the earbuds. However, there's a 'loudspeaker' option that allows the radio to be played through the external speaker, but you still need to keep the earbuds plugged in, as it serves as the 'antenna'.  This means that if you want to hear the radio on your phone, you NEED to have the earbuds with you. You may need to play around with the position of the phone and antenna (or you may have to move) in order to get clear reception. 3/5Misc. Info:Only two games to included, and both trials. (Lumines, Texas Hold'em)You can't transfer games from another phone. You must pay and download them again.You can't delete the pre-created profiles (those that come with the phone). You can just create your own.In order to change the phone to vibrate, you must make a vibrating profile. Then to use it, it takes several steps, which is not hard, but inconvenient.  The interface shows the month and date, but not the day of the week.Only two face templates included with the phone.That's all for now.Overall: 4/"

"Cable, Ziplinq Palm T5 and Treo 650: Cell Phones & Service",4.0,"i bought this for my tungsten e2 since it comes with two separate cables to charge and to hotsync (an idiot design if you ask me), and that area near my computer was becoming plagued with wires and more wires.  and to buy a cradle which used to come with the palms was an extra $30-40!  so i bought this little thing which keeps things incredibly neat, and you just need this plugged into your computer to do both jobs of charging and hotsyncing.  the reason why it got only 4 stars is b/c when i first tried it, my computer said that it didn't recognize the usb device.  i searched everywhere for a technical answer as to why.  it turns out that the connection was just a little loose and it just needed to be pushed into the e2 more.  so the connector part could be a little sturdier, that's all"

Ratcheting Swivel Belt Holster for Motorola V220: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,This holster holds the V220 securely in place.  The only problem might be that it is hard to pull it out of the holster without flipping it open and thus answering the phone.
Ratcheting Swivel Belt Holster for Motorola V220: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This is a good holster for my V220. It doesnt hang up on me as much as the erson who last reviewed it did. For a holster i give it 4 stars because its function is to hold the cell phone in place on your belt. One problem i have with it is that it holds the phone down by where the strap should be, so having a strap on it wouldnt work too well. and also because it holds it where the strap is, it adds a little wear to that area. Other than that its a good holster for the price. And thats another one of my problems. I paid 14 dollars for this at my local mall, which was highly over priced for my standards. Amazon seems like a great place to buy it, but if you search for Motorola V220 Phone Accessories, then you can find a site with free shipping for it, and its 7 bucks. Theres also another site that has it for 3 bucks, but with shipping. I trust amazons shipping though. So if you want a functional holster, get this one"
Starcom Slice Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I have had this phone (and Virgin Mobile pay as you go service) for only a day or two, but I wanted to write this review before I forget. I'll update it if I change my mind.Once you get over the industrial strength plastic clamshell monster it comes in, it's a good ride. The phone resembles a small remote control. It's sleek and unassuming. Turn it on and things get a bit zany with the animations on the color screen, but it's a pleasant experience. The sound quality is good on both ends of the conversation. It's attractive. It works. It seems a real no-brainer given the other choices for the Virgin Mobile service. You can have fun with it or just ignore the fun stuff--but you'll have to get used to the funny graphics.The UI is totally intuitive. You interact with the menus on the screen and the few keys below it as if you've been doing it a while after only setting up your preferences. One thing: this whole service and the software on this phone are marketed to a younger demographic than mine (thirties). While it's a good basic cell phone and the plan is appealing (pay as you go--for me 18c/min), there's a ton of stuff to play with if your train gets stuck in a tunnel. I have Lily Tomlin's operator character answering my voicemail and found a wallpaper with my first name spelled out in diamonds; and if I should ever receive a text message, among my canned response options (that come standard with the phone) are ""Hell no,"" ""Can't talk,"" and ""Leave me alone.""My friend has had one for a few months and loves his. He makes a good bit more money than I and sports some fancy handheld devices, so it's not just that it's so cheap and cool."
Starcom Slice Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I'm a long-running Virgin customer, but additionally I work as a developer in the mobile industry, and so I've had experience using literally scores of handsets from every imaginable carrier (including non-US). Previous Virgin phones I've used include the Vox 8610 and Kyocera 2255. My 8610 still works, but it's a bit bulky and heavy for my tastes and I decided to upgrade.Let's start with the positives:-Very compact design. This is probably the cheapest phone of its size/capabilities available anywhere. It is so thin that when I put it in the same pocket as my wallet, I sometimes forget it's there.-For the cost, it is pretty decent in terms of features. 128x128 screen with fullscreen graphic support, 10 MB for downloads (32 total), speakerphone, web capability, comparable performance to most Nokia series 40 devices. Very long battery life, and fast charging. For those that have had trouble with the battery I suggest you try turning off the backlight. It might have... interesting... effects.-Uses the Sprint network. I've found this to be very reliable in my area, and signal quality is excellent both in and outdoors. -Call quality is good. Comparable to the 8610 as far as I can tell, which was also good (my old Kyocera, on the other hand, was garbage). -UI has a solid, standard design. Predictive text included for messaging. The phone's graphics are a bit odd, but not necessarily in a bad ways.-Durable. UTStarcom knows how to build to last. This handset is no exception.-Good library of games, ringtones, and graphics available. Now I actually have something to spend all that balance on...-Virgin is a very low cost provider. It's no good if you want video on demand, 3G, or whatnot. But for just making calls/texting now and then, you simply can't beat $20/3 months. No annual contract as well, which is a huge plus (as many who've had one know all too well).On the downside:-Keys are a bit small. This is typical of ultra-thin handsets. They are a bit stiff as well, which is good and bad (good because you won't accidentally press them as easily, bad because typing is more of a pain).-Virgin's web browser is lame. Their web service costs extra, and it has problems viewing many page formats (says 'network gremlins' when you try... cute). You can browse basic html, and that's about it- good luck reading e-mail with it.-No bluetooth built-in, though this is to be expected.-No camera either, also to be expected. This can actually be a good thing, since camera phones are off-limits in more areas than you might expect.Bottom line: this handset is great for the price. There are flaws with it, as with any phone, but the pluses outweigh the minuses. I've seen many reviewers complain about both Virgin and the phone, but in my professional opinion (and it is an expert opinion) these people need to realize that you get what you pay for. This isn't a $200 Samsung T519, and you're not paying $60 a month for service on a 2 year contract. Considering the costs, the Slice is an great handset with excellent service, and that is that"
Starcom Slice Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I've been a Virgin Mobile customer for a few years now and have to agree with an earlier reviewer--if you want a phone-phone (without all the extra hoopla) this isn't a bad deal.  I ""*bought"" a red Slice a couple of weeks ago (take note that I'm not one of those people with a cell phone perpetually growing out of one ear) and for my needs (emergencies, quick calls to family from the grocery store) it's just right.  Good points:I got mine for ""*free"" with Reward Zone points at Best Buy.Fits into a small purse or pocket easily.Nice looking (someone mistook it for a ""Chocolate"" the other day).Clear reception (long distance calls are just as crystal as local; not sure if this is an ""area"" thing, but apparently the service in and around Chicago's solid).Pay-as-you-go option works well for someone who doesn't spend a lot of time on the phone.My Slice holds a charge just fine (I've noticed other reviewers have said this is a problem, but so far, so good) and doesn't heat up, as someone else mentioned (maybe that reviewer's got a defective phone or battery?).Not so good points:It's so slim my husband has bet me I'll lose the phone within a couple of months (could be easy to misplace if you keep stacks of papers and books on your desk).Someone else mentioned the odd graphics (hot dog dripping blue sauce, some sort of pipe looking cartoons with teeth.  Seriously, I have no idea what those things might be), but I say it's workable if you have a sense of humor (:Yes, the buttons are small.  I have small hands, slender fingers, and I still manage to bump the ""3"" whenever I'm trying to shut off the phone.Sometimes it's difficult to turn on (the button doesn't always respond when I push it, though could be I'm a wimp), but once it's on it's fine. I'm thinking this will get broken in with more use.All in all, it's not a bad phone.  Beautiful red.  I find myself staring at it just to appreciate its beauty (phone confessions!).I'm satisfied with mine.  And since I haven't forked out hundreds of dollars--or any dollars, really--I won't feel too guilty when/if I do manage to lose it under a pile of paperwork! "
Starcom Slice Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,I got my Slicer past black Friday for $19 from Radio Shack to use in the case of emergency. The Virgin plan 18 c/min pay as you go is excellent for people like me who use cell phone for what they were originally made to do.First $20 phone card lasted me little bit over 2 months (one has to recharge account once every three months to keep the account active) despite a fact that I even made couple overseas calls that were very reasonably priced 30c/min to Eastern Europe. I used the phone on my business trip to call home. The reception was excellent in all 7 states I used the phone so far. The Virgin web site is excellent. The account is easy to recharge. They also have planty of ring tones and graphic options for downloading (mostly priced about $2 per download).The phone is nice looking and has all fancy stuff except a camera.However the memory is really small for more serious web browsing but one would not expect more for $19. I am surprised to hear that other people complained about the battery life. My phone holds charge about 3-4 days on stand by. The only bad thing I discovered so far is that after the switching off the phone (for example during the flight) I had to reconnect phone to charger in order to activate it again.I would sincerely recommend the phone and the Virgin pay as you go plan to mature users
Starcom Slice Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"As a basic phone, the Slice rates OK. I have only a few minor complaints. 1) When a headset is attached the phone does not ring through the external speaker. So if you are not wearing the headset when a call comes in. The call will be missed. 2) There is no option to use vibrate and ring at the same time. It can vibrate or it can ring. 3) The battery life is not as good as stated. In Standby the phone runs out of power after about six hours. 4) With text messaging there is no Reply option. To reply to a text you have to start a new message and then search for the sender of the original message. 5) The ring tones that come with the phone are horrible. Aside from those few problems I have been quite satisfied with the phone"
Starcom Slice Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Two week reviewI got this phone to use as a phone and am very happy with it. I have had it about two weeks now so this is the early review.First, the qualifier. I have a nice canon camera and don't want to use my phone to take pictures. I don't want to use my phone to listen to music or surf the internet either, I just want it to make and receive calls and maybe a text here and there. If you are one of those people that has a different agenda for your phone, then this is probably not the phone for you.The GoodSize is great. This phone is comparable to a Hershey bar in thickness and width, but shorter. It fits in my pants or shirt pocket without feeling bulky.  It makes a razr feel thick, but I am guessing it is comparable to a slvr. The Slice has good sound quality for such a small phone. It also has good reception. Sprints network is not the best in my area, but my slice has been able to connect wherever I am and maintains a strong connection even with 1 bar.When I was in the car, the road noise got too loud to hear, but when I hit the speakerphone button I could hear fine, and keep my hands on the wheel. Virgin is definitely the most affordable option if you are not planning to use the phone a lot. I expect to spend between $150 and $200 this first year, including the $50 up front for the phone. The cheapest monthly plan on the big carriers would cost me at least 500 over a the same period with local taxes and fees included. Although I haven't tried them, it looks like the monthly plans with Virgin are pretty reasonable too if I start getting into that kind of usage level.Many of the other Virgin phones look like toys. Although this ones name sounds like a toy and people under 18 recognize it, it also looks like a real piece of equipment. As an older professional I am not embarrassed to plop this phone on the conference table in a meeting with the VP. (in vibrate mode of course) At the same time, my 12 year old is hoping I hate it and get another phone so he can have this one because it is so cool.The UI is well designed and easy to navigate except for the ridiculous menu. What were they smoking when they decided to use a pig for ""my account,"" a dragon for ""messaging,"" etc. Other than that, the features are all where you would expect them to be and navigating the menus is quite intuitive. Can't really comment on reliability on this phone after just two weeks, but it has already been dropped twice and still works fine.The BadPerhaps because they are affordable in other ways, Virgin screws you on ringtones and background. The four ringtones included are unacceptable, and you are blocked from up or down loading your own. They do have a pretty big collection on their website you can get for $2.50 a pop, but none of them sound like a phone.  The included wallpapers were chosen to be the most despicable choices possible too, so you are likely to fork out $2.00 for a wallpaper from their web site for that as well. The buttons are a little too small. Most of the time I do fine, but every once in a while I hit two keys or the wrong key because they are so small. Of course once the numbers were all loaded into contacts and speed dials set I haven't run into that problem any more. Battery life has not lived up to what I read, but that might be because of how I use it. If I charge it every night I am fine. I ordered an extra charger to keep in the office and one for the car as well just in case.SummaryAfter two weeks I am happy with this phone and would recommend it to someone looking for a phone to use for making phone calls. It is not big on extras like a camera, but what it does it does well. Virgin uses Sprint's network, see if you can find out about their network in your area before you buy a Virgin phone. [..."
LG VX4400 / VX4400B OEM Original Li-Ion Battery - LGLI-ABTM: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,I really like my LG VX4400 phone even though there are lots of cooler phones out now. I've used it for 3 years and really like it's basic functionality. The battery lasted for 3 years until recently and that's pretty good considering how often people lose their phones or have low-battery life. I'm hoping it'll last for 2 more years before I get a new phone to catch up with the modern world

Blackberry 7290/7230 SkinTight w/ Holster- Black: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"The Speck rubber case is the best case i've found for my Blackberry 7290.  That being said, it's not ideal and i'd make a few changes.Pros -- protects case well; no screen scratches; minimizes accidental keystrokes while in your bag; no need to use the belt clip (most women prefer purses/totebags to belt clips!); and i love the fact that you can easily see whether you have new messages (no need to take it out of the case in addition to taking it out of your purse or totebag). Cons -- clear case collects dirt; screen cover is slightly opaque and requires greater use of the backlight; screen cover doesn't fit squarely into the rubber case; and screen cover gets scratches on it, making the screen harder to read.  I get a lot of compliments on this case, it's different enough to be noticed, and people are envious of my ability to quickly check for messages without having to fumble with opening and closing the case.  However, because of the cons, I suspect i'll need to replace this case more than once a year.  But i like it enough that i'll pay the $35 to do so.  Maybe the next version will have some improvements.  In the meantime, i feel like i'm getting my money's worth out of it."

Its is absolutely awesome!No more dings or scratches. I'm a minimalist and for that, the Blackberry Skin is perfect! A cool look, not bulky. Easy access to the buttons.

I use it on my Cingular 8125 phone while I exercise, I can listen to audiobooks on a sports headphone. When a call comes, the AudiblePlayer pauses, and I can answer the phone with the built-in button. Voice quality is fine on my end (in both ears) and I have received no complaints from the other end, unlike the other reviewer (maybe he got a bad unit, or his stereo connector is dirty?). When the call is over, the AudiblePlayer resumes. I never have to stop my exercise, or even slow down! My only complaint is that the volume control doesn't work worth beans. When you rotate it, at various positions, you will hear from one ear or the other. There are a few positions where you will hear in both ears; but, that is not at the maximum volume. This is a bit annoying, but something I can live with. I just leave it at one position (close to the max volume, but a little less), and use the volume control on my cell phone to adjust volume"

Samsung A670 Phone (Verizon Wireless): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I have had this phone for almost 2 years now. I have dropped it many times- still works.  In Dec 06 it went through the washing machine in my pants, I let it dry out for 1 day and guess what- IT WORKS.  I am still using it as it works perfectly - even the camera.I used my sisters Razr phone this weekend and I hated it.  The redial feature was slow and the phone not comfortable.  I will be keeping my Samsung for as long as it lives"
Samsung A670 Phone (Verizon Wireless): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This Samsung is the most reliable phone I've ever had. I've had it for two years, dropped it NUMEROUS times, and it is still going strong with only a few scratches. The battery life has declined during this period of time, but it still lasts about two days before charging. While it does not have as many features as the new phones that are out now, I am impressed with how many applications I use daily - alarm clock, scheduler, memo pad, etc. Reception is usually good too. In all honesty though, the camera is not terribly great. Pictures tend to have a weird color tint when you transfer them to your computer and are often blurry. I still enjoy the camera, if only for the fact that you can fiddle with the options (black and white, brightness, flash, etc.) to make pictures look decent. The video option is rather lame though, as the footage is choppy and you can't even transfer or send it to anything.Recently when I was on a shuttle, two girls, both with Razors, saw my phone and exclaimed that they used to have it as well. Both said they missed it and liked it better than their new phones. I am supposed to be getting a new phone too, but I know I will be keeping this one as a back up. If you are looking for a decent and relatively cheap phone, this is a good one"
Samsung A670 Phone (Verizon Wireless): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Almost 2 years ago, my fiance and I signed up for a 2-year contract with Verizon. We got a great deal for both phones. And two years later, both phones are in excellent condition with very few scratches and dents. This is a great phone for someone who would still like the option to take pictures and short videos but does not use it heavily. I have 38 pictures saved on my phone right now and sending picture messages is extremely easy and relatively quick with this phone. Pros: - Sturdy: It's not as thin or flimsy as some of the newer ultra-thin        phones. I have dropped my phone so many times and my phone is still in excellent condition. Another thing I really like is that when you drop the phone, the battery doesn't detach easily. Everytime I dropped my old sony ericsson, the battery would also detach and I'd have to restart my phone. - Compact: Though it is on the thicker side, this Samsung is very compact but not too small where you fear loosing it.  - Good Buttons: For those who text message a lot, the way the buttons feel can really make a difference. The buttons on this phone are smooth and great for texting. - Menu & short cuts: On the side of the phone, you can adjust your ringtone volume by simply pressing the up or down arrow. If you hold #, your phone goes into vibrate mode. If press the camera button on the right hand side of the phone the camera & video menu pop up. You can also choose which shortcut you'd like when you press ""up,"" I have mine set on the calendar.  - Long battery life: I'm not one to spend hours on my cell phone, but for every day use, this phone is great with respect to its battery life. There have been times when I forget to charge my phone and go 2 days without charging and it is still close to fully charged. - Camera has flash & other neat options: You can also adjust the brightness level, have a self timer, take multiple shots, 10 different ""fun frames,"" and 5 different colortones like sepia, monochrome (black & white and negative.  - Zoom: You can zoom upto X4.  - Phonebook: Contacts are easy to access and it's easy to search for entries. I like the fact that you can enter multiple numbers under one name. You can enter that persons home, mobile, fax, office and pager number. You can also enter an alias and email address. You can assign a personalized ring tone and picture and you can categorize your contacts in different groups. - Voice commands:By pressing & holding the * button, a voice command menu appears. It's a nice feature but is not something I often use. - Speed dailing: One feature that I do take advantage of is speed dailing. It's nice only having to press a button to instantly connect with another person. - Menu styles: There are 2 different menu styles you can use. I like the nature option which has cute animation for each subcategory you scroll through. My fiance uses the icon style which is a more simple design. - Custom welcome and goodbye screen.Cons: - Video quality is poor and very pixelated. My phone only holds 2 15-second videos. - Despite the generous 15 ring tones, it's hard finding a ringtone that doesn't make you want to pull your hair out. Out of the 15 ring tones, there are only about 2 decent ring tones. - Antenna: I don't use the antenna very often but when I do, it has a hard time staying up and is very flimsy. - Picture quality is not the best. If you intend on taking a lot of pictures I would recommend investing in a better picture phone. - Does not have V-Cast. - No MP3 player.Overall: This cell phone is exactly that, a cell phone to make calls. It has some additional features like picture taking and video and organization tools like the phonebook and planner but it is still a fairly basic phone."
Samsung A670 Phone (Verizon Wireless): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,this phone is great.

I've also run it through the dryer twice, dropped it countless times, thrown it at a wall, and ran over it on a mountain bike. The camera still works, and I think the reception actually got BETTER after going through the washer. All it has is some scratches on the casing and a bent antenna.

Genuine Contour Carrying Case for Motorola Razr V3 V3c V3i V3m (Baby Pink): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"The case fits like a glove!  Appears high quality with the rich leather look and feel and detailed stitching.  The cover and back were easy to attach and did not scratch my phone, which I checked by removing the case. My only complaint was that I did not like the small mount on the back to attach the carry clip since I never carry my phone on my belt. The attachment kept my phone from laying flat.  No problem, if you slide off the back cover, and take off the small foam piece on the inside, you will see a tiny screw.  Just unscrew and remove the mount.  There will be a hole in your cover; if you do not like that just reapply the foam piece. Attach the back cover to the phone and then fill in the hole with a piece of felt.  Looks fantastic. If you are a clip user, the clip is clear plastic and cheap looking and I found it difficult to remove the phone from it. But maybe that is a good thing so that it won't fall off accidentally.I cannot comment on how well the case will wear since I have only had a few days.  My friends that have seen it love the new look.  I chose the navy blue case and am truly amazed at how well the case fits the phone.  Awesome!!"

Net10 Motorola Prepaid Cellular Phone - Blue (NTGC139): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I've had TracFone service for 2 days now and glad I switched.  The C139 is small compact and fits in my shirt pocket.  It lacks in ring tones and the address book could be better but for a simple phone, it's all I need. I don't need the internet access and all the other features I end paying for and not using.  TracFone was quick to transfer my phone number which happened in 1 day and they said it would take 7 days. I'm impressed with their service so far. I won't go back to overpriced Sprint who had me locked in on a service agreement for 2 years.  I have good service and will be saving $300+ a year now.  If you want a nice small light and simple phone that all you want to do is make and receive phone calls, this is the one"
Net10 Motorola Prepaid Cellular Phone - Blue (NTGC139): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"For the $50 bucks you pay here, you get the phone plus 300 minutes of airtime.  That's not a bad deal considering if you bought the phone itself elsewhere, it would be $20 bucks, and buying the airtime separately would also total approximately $20 some odd bucks or so.  Plus tax. So cost works about to be about the same.  Frankly, I see no savings to buying this phone on this site versus elsewhere. Regarding the sim card, I noticed nothing unusual or problematic about insertion.  A sim card is a delicate silicon apparatus that is highly susceptible to ESD -electro static discharge- just like computer RAM is.  ESD is probably the primary reason why so many reviewers phones here have failed.  I'd bet every single one of them reside in geographical locations where the weather is cold and snows.  Before you handle the sim card, you should ""ground"" yourself by touching something metal.  Otherwise you run the risk of destroying the sim card with ESD.The phone itself is OK.  It's BASIC.  Emphasis on the basic.    I just transferred my mobile # from a Motorola V120c and notwithstanding the annoying 20 polyphonic ringtones on the c139, about the only edge the c139 has over the V120c is the color display.  Please also note that c139 does not have any kind of interface as to a pc so that means you are stuck with the bundled ringtones and the wallpaper.  IMO, Motorola could have added a port to accomodate a USB interface to this model.  It was short-sighted and just dumb not to considering the V120c -also in the same price range- has such a port.  Voicemail is extremely problematic to set up at this time.  I only just had the phone activated on this past Saturday (10/28/06) and it took over 5 hours for my number to be transferred over to the new phone.  Also, it is an entirely new network.  In Southern California, the network this model TracFone uses is Cingular.  Suffice it to say, I followed all the instructions on the website explicitly, however Cingular just keeps regurgitating its canned message that it doesn't recognize my number and to input my voicemail number. And around and around it goes.  I anticipate nothing but problems with ""technical support"" when I contact them.  They are very polite as customer service reps, however they can barely speak or understand English.  I am envisioning hours of BS with the call I have to make because past experience has indicated to me that these reps are not technical whatSOever. Note to Tracfone:  Customer service reps from Mexico who can barely communicate with your American consumers are most assuredly NOT TECH SUPPORT.  Also, I wasn't overly impressed with the keypad where it concerns text messaging.  The V120c is actually more intuitive. It's much easier to use.  But the c139 does have one advantage in this regard - text messages cost only 0.3 units versus on the V120c, TracFone was deducting 0.5 units for each incoming and outgoing text message.  I'm not sure why that is considering the deduction of units has zip to do with the model of the phone.  It should be one uniform deduction across the board.  Consumers should contact TracFone customer service and inquire about this phenomenon.Bottom line is that I would recommend this phone to anyone who is upgrading from a monochromatic LED phone and wants an *inexpensive* phone with a much easier on the eyes color display.  Inexpensive as in you bought it from a retailer for $20 bucks.  But if you want pretty new ringtones and wallpaper, and a little more flexibility, then get yourself a Nokia 2126. For the same money you spend here, the Nokia is a better phone.  It has a USB port, a speakerphone, plus other extras.  And you probably won't have any trouble setting up the voicemail either."

LG C1500 Phone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,I have had this phone for about 6 months now and all together is has been great. I mean it dont have bluetooth but besides that its good. I have had so many hightech phones but end up dropping them and breaking them or finding them in my daughters purse in a million pieces. This phone i dont have that problem it is really made good. i have dropped it off my car going down the road and went back and got it and its fine.
LG C1500 Phone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Are we all talking about the same phone here? I haven't had any problems with it and using it is a breaze. I bought this phone after I wanted to change my calling plan so I wouldn't get stuck with roaming charges while I was away, far from my calling area. My old phone (also an LG) wasn't compatible with this new calling plan because it was embedded with the old AT&T service. I love the fact that I can download MP3 ringtones to this phone because that was one thing that I was looking for. I also like the fact that it has a speakerphone. It does not have a camera, and I was not looking for one. I already own three very good stand alone cameras, why bother with another?? I was although a little aggravated having to re-enter all of my old phone book information because that's the only way you can do it. The manual is not hard to read at all unless you are dyslexic."

Sony Ericsson Z610i Rose Pink Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,Be careful - Amazon identifies this phone as being GSM 850MHz.  It is not.  Read the 'Vital Statistics' section in the full write up and you will see no mention of 850MHz.  Check the Sony web page (and other people who sell this phone) and you will see that it does not work on 850MHz.I don't own this phone but was researching it for a friend when I discovered this discrepancy.  I gave it 4 stars because of the cool Magic Mirror case - I have no idea if this phone is really good or not
Motorola i880 Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,I love this phone.  I can do so much with it.  It is light weight and fun to carry.  I love the button flip feature.  Great phone!!
Motorola i880 Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,Purchased this phone a little over a month ago and so far everything works well and have no problems.  Many nice features and the service in the state of GA is good
Motorola i880 Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I bought this phone as part of the Sprint/Nextel SERO plan.I used it for about 14 days before deciding that it didn't fit my needs for several reasons outlined below:- Battery life was sporadic -- I got maybe a day worth of power from it. One time it completely discharged overnight. For the price of the phone (and the two year contract it carries) this is a dealbreaker.- The Nextel network coverage has gone downhill in my area (I was a former Nextel subscriber for 3 years - so I have some experience with coverage around town). I was getting disconnects and sporadic no signals.- The phone would sporadically mute the ringer. An incoming call would light up the display but there would be no ringing. This seems to happen after I had put the phone on vibrate and then turned it back to ring.- For the same monthly service fee, I was getting less access to web services and no high speed Internet ability. Admittedly the high speed access is not as useful on a tiny screen -- but if I'm going to be locked into a 2 year contract I would like to have some fast internet access on the phone. The i880 still uses the slow Nextel data network.I was not a Direct Connect/Walkie Talkie user. If I were, then my opinion of this phone might be a little higher (since Nextel presently has arguably the best fully functioning walkie talkie network). I could not justify being locked into a 2 year contract with equipment that seemed sub-par on a network that did not (and likely never will) support the latest high speed technologies.Below were my initial impressions during the time I used the phone:Thankfully Motorola designed the phone so the micro-SD card is accessible from the outside -- no need to pull the battery to update the card. Here's the big things I don't like.1. You CANNOT use any mp3 songs that you transfer to the micro-sd card as ringtones. 2. You also cannot readily load additional wallpapers unless it is a picture you took with the phone or a paid download. Any message (mms) that you send to yourself can only be set as a caller id image and not wallpaper. 3. Battery life on my phone is flaky - I'm getting maybe a day and one-half with usage that approximates 60 minutes talk time and perhaps 6 to 10 picture messages.You must pay Nextel to download ringtones. There are some users who have modified the phone and reportedly are able to use ringtones off their micro-SD memory card - however the process is more technical than what your average user might want to tangle with.Note: Sprint and Nextel are both owned by the same company. If you're making a decision on Sprint vs. Nextel, there are only a couple reasons that I can think of to recommend Nextel over Sprint. First, if the Nextel coverage is better. Second, if you have a need to use the Nextel Walkie Talkie feature.The Sprint side of the company features phones with significantly enhanced web browsing and higher speed data communications. The Nextel side clings to the larger phones and aims their services at the industrial/construction market. For almost every consumer, the Sprint side is a better deal. Sprint in my experience has better customer service whereas Nextel tends to transfer you endlessly among a variety of customer service representatives.Here's my summary of this phone after using it about two weeks:The Good:-beautiful speaker phone-compact design / solid feel-2 megapixel camera, ability to capture movies-flip swings open when you push a button-Nextel sms/mms messages can now be auto-downloaded - I believe this is the first Nextel phone to sport this feature-nice loud audio-both Nextel walkie talkie and DirecTalk supportThe Bad:-can't play ringtones off Micro SD or via any other non-Nextel transfer (Note: Technically some people have been using a Motorola product called webjal to make transfers with a cable - but this may be more technical than the average user would like to tackle)-Nextel is in my opinion on their way out as a carrier, soon to be completely assimilated into the Sprint side of things. While not entirely unexpected, it means that Nextel plans and features are not as attractive to non-construction users (Nextel's core group). If you want Mobile to Mobile unlimited minutes you pay more versus most Sprint plans which include them. Nextel doesn't have the super fast data speeds or network web browsing of competing carriers. Most web browsing on Nextel is limited to character based wap sites that both crawl along speedwise and present unexciting character based screens.-the phone is a little bigger that what some have grown accustomed to.-while not phone related, some users in larger cities have reported the iDen system is nearing capactity with a lot of busy signals.-I am only getting about a day of battery life - which is extremely low."
Cingular 8525 Designio Leather Case: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"Very well-thought design. I just wished I looked up at the pictures on here again before I pushed my 8525 in without sliding out the keyboard first. I thought it was weird. But after I looked at the pictures again.. man.. how brilliant! They should've provided some sort of User Guide on how to put the case on. And the leather is of a very high quality too. The seller is awesome, very Amazon-like shipping (i.e. fast)"
Cingular 8525 Designio Leather Case: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This product is definitely worth the $30. The leather is nice and what you can't see from the picture is that the item is held into the case by a plastic covering over the keyboard. When closing the keyboard, the plastic does catch a little, but I think that will go away the more I use it. The phone fits snugly into the case and no part of the screen is covered by the leather exterior. Access to the buttons have been made easy. Each exterior button is given its own hole in the leather. The ok button and ptt button on the left are covered by leather however there is clear markings in the leather designating, ""ok"" and ""ptt."" The leather faceplate is secured by a magnet providing easy and quick access to the touchscreen. On the flopside of the faceplate is a convenient mesh pouch for memory cards or etc. Another thing not mentioned in its description is that it comes with a belt clip, however there is no place to secure the belt clip onto the case. Highly Recommende"

Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth Headset - Silver: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I ordered this headset in silver - Webtreo sent out white, but said that even though it appears white, it really IS silver! We argued about the color, and I finally convinced them that Samsung makes white, silver, red, and black. It took almost a month to get resolved, but I finally have the silver headset that I ordered. It is very small, light, and easy to use. There are 3 different size earpieces for a better fit. The headset gets 4 stars, Webtreo only gets 1 star.I wouldn't order any products from them again"
Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth Headset - Silver: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This is by far the best bluetooth headset in the market, it is small and very light as well, just like wearing an earing.  The sound is amazingly clear, people on the other end thought I was actually using my phone.  I have no problem with it falling off, just make sure the stopper is placed correctly inside your ear.  I'm so happy with this cutie that I'm buying it for my sisters & friends"
Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth Headset - Silver: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Consumer Reports correctly deemed the Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset as the best. I can hear my callers while driving and they can hear me. The Samsung is also an extremely small and discrete headset, so you won't look like a cheesy phone operator while driving in your car. And if you want to be one of ""those"" people who use their Bluetooths while walking around in public places, it's small enough where people will really wonder if you're a crazy person talking to yourself. Gimme a break! The Samsung also comes with a cool carrying case that doubles as a charger. This is super handy since the headset is so small and would be easy to lose or damage if not for the sturdy (but not at all bulky) carrying case.The Samsung is the first Bluetooth headset that I did not quickly return due to poor headset volume. I returned my LG and Nokia Bluetooths after my first few drives in my car. I simply could not hear the people to whom I was talking. The Samsung is the first to provide enough volume. I'm still happy with it after two months of ownership.The Samsung was also approximately $35 cheaper on Amazon than at Best Buy or other retailers, whether online or in person. So buy it from Amazon's retailers.The only reason I gave the Samsung four stars and not five is because of the short talk time and because it does not stay in your ear while running. I learned this one morning when I was late for work and ran from my car to my office. The Samsung quickly began to fall out of my ear.If the Samsung's short talk time is not a concern for you, then I doubt there are too many other Bluetooth headsets in this price range that will provide better performance in such an extremely small package"

Sony Ericsson ICE-26 OEM Leather Case for Z500a Z520a W710i Z710i W300i W600 Z525a Z300a in ORIGINAL Sony Ericsson Packaging!: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,This case has good quality construction and fits properly. It solves the problem of being able to plug in the proprietary cord for the ear phones while still being in the case. Two things kept me from rating it 5 stars. I prefer a magnetic closure to velcro which this case uses. I also prefer the option of having the phone horizontal on my belt which I find less cumbersome while working. The fixed belt clip design only allows vertical positioning. This is still the best optional case if you want to use the MP3 player feature and require the use of earphones

No, it probably WON'T provide much protection if you drop your phone. It DOES protect your RAZR from scratches and fingerprints, and the rubberized material is easy to grip and feels great in your hand. The cutouts for the outside display, camera (I have a V3m), and M logo are perfectly placed and the whole cover fits well. I don't use the belt clip, as the cover by itself adds hardly any bulk so I just keep my phone in my pocket. Without the belt clip, there is a small 'snap' that sticks out a bit from the back of the cover but it's really no big deal. For the $3, you can't beat this. :-"

I just talked to a cust care representative, who confirmed that cancelling included data plan before 180-day period will invalidate $250 Amazon phone rebate. Well, I guess that is a major turn down for me for this phone and this offer, since I don't really need a data plan, and planned to use WiFi connectivity most of the time. Any comments?I still would like to give it 5 stars since I believe it is a great product. I'll take one star off however, due for its weak battery life, and lack of standard audio connection (2.5"" or 3.5"" minijack). "
Cingular 8525 PDA Phone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"There are many good reviews on 8525 positive features and most are fairly accurate.  Lots of good features in the 8525.  My intent is to document some of the shortcomings of the 8525 and Windows Mobile OS in the hope that MS and HTC will heed and correct in the future.  I am a business user who wanted to combine my HP IPAQ 1945 and my Motorola V550 Cell phone into one device. I use a Motorola H700 headset with my old devices and the 8525.My overall assessment is; Replacing my two 3 year old devices resulted in me accepting some compromises that I don't think are necessary in terms of functionality and ease of use.  All the features I describe below were in the earlier Windows Mobile OS used by my IPAQ 1945 or my Motorola flip phone. If readers find that there is a way to perform any of the deficiencies I describe please let me know.  My suggestions in rough order of priority:1)  Blue tooth headsets. Blue tooth audio should always come through the blue tooth headset regardless of the PDA volume setting.  To hear my voice commands repeated, I have to turn on the annoying sound of the PDA, so when I voice dial via my Blue tooth headset, I can hear my voice commands repeated back.  I am referring to the standard voice dial that comes with the 8525.  One quick solution would be to tie BT headset to the phone volume setting rather than the PDA.  Even nicer would be an upgrade that allows full audio with the ""VoiceCommand"" software (this is documented in many other reviews).  Another nice feature of my Motorola cell phone was as soon as the BT was detected the phone volume changed from vibrate to audio if it was set to vibrate.  It changed back to the original audio setting after turning off the BT headset.1a)  If I request voice dial via my blue tooth headset the screen should ALWAYS display the voice dial page.  Instead the initial ""Owner Info"" page stays up and you can't see the name on the screen unless you reach down and tap the screen.  Not desirable when driving.  If you didn't set the PDA to its annoying noise level you can't hear the name you requested either.2) Need to be able to control the PDA and phone volume independently for Audio, Vibrate or OFF.  For example need to be able to tie turn up the phone volume while keeping the PDA volume setting on OFF or vibrate.  3) Need to be able to program how long the display stays on.  I am constantly groping to find the power button on the side to keep the display on as it turns off when I need to see something.  4) I would buy a non Bluetooth headset if one was available for long drives when my BT headset battery is dead.  Only solution I see is the 8525 stereo headphones and turning on the speaker which is a little noisy for listeners while driving on the freeway.5) Provide a built in way to make the PTT and Comm Manager, and IE Quick key buttons programmable.  I would use them for many other functions; such as PTT bringing up the volume control so I can change it from vibrate to audio to speaker (need to be able to select speaker here see below).6) Give me a way to press an external button to toggle between speaker on and off.  I can't easily push the speaker icon with my fingers.  Suggestion. Add a radio button on the volume control that allows you to select speaker phone. Yes you can select the phone speaker soft button, but often the display has gone blank and the keypad is showing.  Turning speaker on/off should be easier. 7) Provide option to save email attachments to storage card.  That was on my IPAQ Windows OS and allowed me to capture lots of attachments without running out of memory. 8) Remember the Filter setting I selected for Tasks.  If I have filtered by a task category during that session remember the filter I selected.   Currently I have so many tasks there is a 5 second delay to bring them all up 9) Give me a way to turn off have the Internet browser Quick Key (or make this button programmable) I am always having to close the browser because it gets hit/selected10) Let me Edit/Paste with one step for notes, word, task notes etc.  The IPAQ has ""Edit"" at the bottom.  With 8525 OS you must select Menu, then Edit, then Copy.  Keep Edit on the bottom. Question: is there a key on the keypad to select CNTRL C for copy like what is done on a PC (the letters are underlined in the menu, but I don't see a CNTRL key on the keypad?11) Allow the trackwheel to scroll up to the icons on the top and then use the nav button to move across the icons (might be the way to allow an external way to set audio volume)12) If I power off the device have it remember my input selection.  For example I select ""Letter Recognizer"".  But I must reset each time I power 8525 off.  "
Cingular 8525 PDA Phone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I recently got the 8525 and i loved it at first mainly because of the multi functions it could do. However eventually i found out that the phone part of this pda is not as great as my previous camera phone. My friends complain that they hear a lot of outside noise while talking. The phone ear-volume is quite low and i have to constantly put it to max it if i am in noisy places.Pros:Software : The windows applications - Word, Excel, Media player.            Plus : Ability to create office documents and play games Hardware : Micro sd slot - Sandisk card cost me 20 bucks.Wireless Internet : You could connect this device to any wireless unsecure network to get to the internet. I dont have a data plan with Cingular but i connect to the internet from home through my WIFI home network. If iam at a coffee shop i could connect to their secure network and get to internet for free.Cons :* A bit bulky to carry around.* Camera is not as expected. The view finder is sloppy and cannot capture images in low light.* Battery needs to be charged every second day (depends on usage) but even with light use i had to charge it every other day.Best suitable for :* Internet savvy people who are on the move.* Email and messaging.* As a pocket PC.* To listen to music (need to purchase micro-sd card)Accessories:Boxwave leather case ($30)Leather case by Boxwave fits pretty good and protects the device. The only problem is that after you put this case on, the phone volume needs to be set to the max, even after that you wont be able to hear the other person so well. But the boxwaver case could be opened half way and folded over.BluetoothThis device works very well with blue tooth.Bottom line:If you are ok with minor inconveniences while using the phone this is for you.

Cingular 8525 PDA Phone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"This is a wonderful device. Build quality is typical of HTC, meaning very good. The call quality is good provided you're in a decent service area (system not overloaded with AMR-HR kicking in). The scroll wheel is a very useful addition to the Hermes line and makes one handed use much more manageable. The slide out keyboard is easy to use and provides very good tactile feedback. There is a huge user community and a very large knowledge base to consult (this is perhaps the ultimate ""geek"" phone). The WM5 ROM it currently ships with is fairly stable and provides the usual suite of applications and productivity tools. There is a learning curve involved with Windows Mobile, but IMHO it's not nearly so bad as some ppl make it out to be. In general, things work as they are supposed to with this phone.One drawback is that while the device does support the Bluetooth A2DP profile (stereo bluetooth sound), the Microsoft Bluetooth stack as found on this device is horrible. The phone ships with A2DP forced to mono, which means you'll have to manually edit the registry to enable true stereo sound over bluetooth. The bluetooth stereo sound is also set to a very low quality, which also involves a series of registry tweaks to improve. And even after all of that, there still exists audible inaccuracies and artifacts in the audio. In other words, don't waste your money on a set of stereo bluetooth headphones if you take your audio seriously. However, the bluetooth does work very reliably with most regular (mono/one ear) BT headsets (I recommend the Jawbone), and the call and voice quality experienced in call with these devices is perfectly acceptable.Another audio related drawback of this device: There is not even a 2.5mm stereo jack. The only physical audio out is through HTC's proprietary jack which is also the power and data jack. The saving grace here is that the earbuds the unit ships with are actually passable, and also the availability of HTC-to-3.5mm jack adapters on the market.Even with a few shortcomings, I would be remiss to not point out that this is probably the best PocketPC Phone on the US carrier subsidized market. It packs an incredible amount of power into a remarkably usable form factor. If you're in need of a Windows Mobile device and a fan of the slide out qwerty keyboard instead of the dedicated keyboard devices, this is your phone"
Cingular 8525 PDA Phone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Purchased this phone as a replacement for my old skool Verizon XV6600 and I am extremely impressed.  I have been a PocketPC Phone user for several  years now and it appears the 8525 along with Windows Mobile 5 is very close to nirvana for this IT Professional-by-day \ GadgetFreak-by-night guy.If you don't read anything else in my review please understand this:1)  This is a Microsoft OS and things will go bump.2)  If you are NOT in the market for spending around $110 a month for a service plan (voice and data), you have no business with this phone.This is a productiviy enhancer, it is not %100 perfect but as a data center manager who receives around 200 emails a day along with about 200 system notifications a day, this phone does the trick.The battery life isn't that bad as I have this thing in its cradle (not included) during the day.Screen is bright.The WiFi feature works beautifully.The 3G network is amazingly fast.Works flawlessly with my Exchange 2003 server.  (Active Sync is so easy to setup, a noob could do it.)The only reason reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the fact that it can't make me a cocktail"
Cingular 8525 PDA Phone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This phone is also sold as the Dopod 838 Pro in Asia (it's quite popular in Singapore), and the HTC TyTN in Europe, but in an unlocked model. and quite a bit more expensive than what Cingular sells it for here.  If you are using this as your first PDA phone from another non Windows product, you will think it's a heavy, over feature laden product that you will never fully use, and its a problematic one at that.  Having said that, this is probably one of the best Windows PDA phones available today.  The features of this phone (3.5G, Bluetooth 2.0, etc. ) are such that you would never need to bring a laptop with you.  You can even install Skype Mobile on this phone.  The keyboard stows away well, and has good feel.There were initial problems with this phone in the Asian market, that have now been since resolved, and is now robust and reliable.But one caveat to keep in mind when using this product...it runs Windows Mobile.  Meaning, if you are not familiar with Windows devices, it may frustrate you...it doesn't respond like a non Windows cell phone.  But, if you can overlook that, it will perform better than anything available...even Blackberry devices do not compare to this"
Cingular 8525 PDA Phone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"Many of my colleague use blackberry for emails but I give a try on this brand-new 3G/Wi-fi/camera equipped smartphone.  The 3G and Wi-fi works very well in our area.  It also worked very well in Europe after activation of the cellphone by Cingular customer service.  E-mail and internet works very well in both locations.  Addition of 1GB microSD chip actually solve many of the bluetooth file transfer issues, since I can simply stick the microSD card into regular SD cassette, and use a card reader and USB cable for file transfer from PC or Mac like other memory chips.  The color calibration and default focus of the camera is very good and video is very good quality for the cameraphone.  Again, 1GB allow you to take a very long video in Windows Media Player format.  Installation of Good mail system automatically synchronize to Lotus Note emails, contacts, and calendar any time, any place, and automatically chime schedule notices. The only drawback are the battery life, which require frequent charges, slow keypad for phone calls (and I do not know how to silence the keypad), and a little tough keyboard touch.  Lack of shift keys on both sides sometimes makes key typing difficult (especially shift+A !).  In addition, Microsoft Word processing is slow, and so as Excel, which will require a faster chip. Overall, a great all-around pocket PC in this generation"

Cingular 8525 PDA Phone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Hi, I just recently purchased this phone. and so far these are the problems. Yes you do have to restart the device, it does get hung, but i don't blame the phone, after all it has windows mobile 5 in it. The restart has occurred twice to me in the past week, So be careful. This phone is pretty close to being perfect. Other than the fact that it has windows, The 3G connection is crazy fast and it is amazing to have. If you take this phone be ready to take a good data connect plan as even thought it has wifi capabilities, Cingular has programed it to first connect to their data connect feature.. which in return will give u a nice thick bill.. Once you buy the phone i suggest that  you get this software Spb Pocket plus. It helps shutting down softwares running in the background, and adds more features. The screen clarity is amazing and it has great features. It can connect up to 6 bluetooth devices at once. Overall i give it a 4 because of the hardware. the one star missing is cause it has Windows. Sorry Microsoft but you need to remove the bugs outta this windows too."

And best of all very, very user friendly. "
Nokia N80 Internet Edition Black Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I've had this phone for a week. I'm using it with T-Mobile, so your mileage may vary. In my opinion, it's a feature-packed phone at a reasonable price (for an unlocked smart phone, at least). The Symbian 9 OS runs pretty well, although I did experience some lags and software freezes (with third-party apps). Fixing it was a matter of rebooting. I think the menu organization could be smarter, but you can customize much of it. I do love that the default screen displays your day's calendar agenda. But that screen hides the main menu. Not a huge drawback, but it confused me at first.Photos with the 3-megapixel camera are grainy (it also has a VGA camera). Since this is a phone first, and not a camera, there is also no stabilization control. It does, however, come with a flash.  Sound quality of phone calls is okay. Your friends, family and colleagues will hear you clearly. On your end, however, it will sound like you're talking on a cell phone. It's not bad, but I've had conversations on better sounding phones.  I disagree slightly with another commenter about wireless internet (WLAN) access. It's possible to set a default access point. The problem is that if you aren't at that location regularly, you will have to search for a new network. One way around it is to pony up the cash for a data plan through your wireless provider. I agree, however that some kind of one-button auto-detect would be ideal. I don't like the SIM card slot. The metal cover pops off fairly easily -- as I found out while trying to insert my SIM card without reading the manual first. The phone's slider form factor moves smoothly, perhaps too much so. By default, sliding the phone completely open -- something that's hard, but not impossible to do accidentally -- unlocks the keypad.  The N-80 is also bit awkward. It feels thick for lack of a better word. Its 5-way controller button also looks and feels a bit cheaper than you'd probably expect. Another drawback: no QWERTY keyboard. You can connect to a wireless one via Bluetooth. But that assumes you want to carry a keyboard. The upshot is that the predictive text feature is solid and sensible. When enabled, it works contextually: on automatically for SMS and email messages and off when typing URLs.Overall, I give this phone high marks for features, but a few annoyances mean it's far from The Perfect Phone"
Nokia N80 Internet Edition Black Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I got this phone 2 weeks back although I have seen this with my cousin in Singapore quite sometime back. Just right off the box, the phone is quite impressive. Many complain about the response time - yes, this phone is slow but doesn't bother me - far better than my windows machine  Overall, very good phone for what it offers. Pros:*	This phone tops in ergonomics, ease of use, presentation, features, Bluetooth, speakerphone and call quality. *	Wi-fi is worth mentioning separately. It is simply superb.*	Nokia's connection manager is far superior than anyone else in the market. It handles very efficiently that one can easily choose between several access points and save lots of money. I accidentally downloaded a big chunk of data and going to pay through my nose next month!*	All the apps that come with this phone are quite good. *	BT sync with my apple is just fine with iSync. Also I transfer music/themes/ringtones using data cable from my Wintel. The phone automatically toggles to ""Mass storage"" mode when it is connected to PC, which is pretty neat. *	I haven't faced any such problem as I charge my gadgets daily. I also tried leaving it uncharged and it comes for 2-3 days, good enough for my call volumes. *	Symbian browser is fast and stunning. Bookmarks feature is neat. Having the wi-fi feature helps you to set all the bookmarks while you're at home and then use it wisely while you are away. *	Camera quality is good. Dual camera is just a great idea. Camera settings are similar to professional cameras - very very impressive!*	Tried the video mode and came fine. *	Battery life, as many claim, seems short - but I charge my gadgets daily - so not a big issue*	The headset that comes with the phone is really good. *	Tonnes of themes, apps etc available for this phone..... Cons*	My first biggest problem is that the main navigation key is badly designed. It is made of cheap plastic and almost 8 out of 10 times I ""selected"" an option when I was actually trying to navigate to left. It is SO frustrating.*	My second biggest problem with this phone is when the slider is on, the screen light does not come up. So you won't know - even in the day - which button to press to answer the question ""Unlock phone?"" - you will get that by practice but it is truly a pain. *	The process of taking a picture sucks. The picture what you see on the screen when you hear the shutter sound is NOT what you get. There is a serious lag between the shutter click and the final image. I sincerely hope if there would be some s/w patch for this. I am anyway not a big fan of phone cameras - with an exception of Sony Ericsson W810i. That is one far superior camera quality I saw so far.*	Slider lock and unlock feature is good and bad. I am putting this on the bad section as even if the slider opens in your pocket, the phone could turn on and end up with accidental redialing. So you would need a small app to do the locking properly.Overall - good phone. At this point, Nokia has better phones like N95 etc - of course very expensive."

The retractable cord is an awesome feature you can actually talk on the phone while your driving because the cord is pretty long unlike ones that you can purchase from cigular, or sprint stores."

Battery for Palm Treo 680: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"This battery performs as expected.It is the standard Palm battery - meaning it is probably underpowered relative to the power consumption of the device. Note also that when using Bluetooth and/or the Blackberry Rim email service battery life is notably reduced.The solution would be lower device consumption, or a bigger capacity battery - neither of which appear possible at the moment.So my solution was to have a second spare battery"

"Lithium Ion Battery for Motorola V60,V65, i730, i58, i860: Cell Phones & Service",5.0,"These are well worth the money for your Nextel Phone!  Although it may not list it, from Experience, these batteries fit 95% of all the Nextel phones.  Take a look at your phone battery to see if it's the same shape.  The color will be different as these have a white cover.  They are a good twenty dollars cheaper than if you purchased one in your local Cellular store.  Plus these were NEVER used before!  Unlike the celluar store battery, these batteries come in a box, with the battery in shrink wrap, so you know the battery has not been used.  When you buy then in the cellular store, they are in a plastic box that can be opened and closed (and you'd never know it) plus there is no shrink wrap!  Ever buy a battery from a cellular store and have it start not holding a charge long after only a few months?  Hmmm, I wonder if you actually have a new battery or a used one?  Would you know????These batteries are well worth it!  Buy one or two extra to keep charged in case of an emergency or put an extra in your car or desk for those long days"

Motorola Adaptable Dual Pocket Desktop Charger for Motorola V60 Series Phone: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This is a great little desktop charger pocket for the Motorala V60 and an additional battery.  However, it seems expensive for what you get, not to mention the fact that what the text doesn't tell you is that you need an *additional* (expensive?) serial cable/adapter in order to use it with your regular charger cable.

CELLET STINGRAY CASE with DETACHABLE SWIVEL CLIP for HTC Wizard / 8125 / 8100 / MDA (USA) / K-JAM: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,This product is great.  It fits like a glove and protects the phone while allowing you to view the screen unlike other cases
CELLET STINGRAY CASE with DETACHABLE SWIVEL CLIP for HTC Wizard / 8125 / 8100 / MDA (USA) / K-JAM: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Pros:Fits the phone very snuggly.  Made of interesting flexible material that fells like a rubbery neoprene like polymer.  All buttons of the phone are accessible through the case.  The belt clip is sturdy and removable so you can wear the phone on your belt and easily remove and reinstall it on the belt clip without taking the belt clip off of your waist.Cons:You cannot access the keyboard without removing the phone from the case.  The clear plastic screen that covers the phone's screen is a little to far from the surface of the phone's screen.  This makes it more difficult to press buttons on the phone screen with the stylus near the corners of the screen.  The clear plastic screen protector may stretch with use and make this easier but I'm not sure.  On the positive side, you can easily cut out the clear plastic screen and still use the case with some extra stick on screen protectors that can be found online."
Palm Treo 600 PDA Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Picture quality sucks for the price. Colors are way freaky. The screen is perfect for text but not for pictures. Viewing pictures on this is terrible. Keyboard is ackward at first. The manual needs to be much more detailed. Sorta confusing to use if not familliar with palm pilots. I expected to use it like a typical pilot, where you write on the screen. This feature is not implemented.  Overall, this is a very good phone. Good reception, great sound quality!! Speakerphone is great! Neat features. Worth the $$"
Palm Treo 600 PDA Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"The Treo600 has all the functions I needed -- phone, calendar, camera, etc.  Two shortcomings: 1) the screen is not good for viewing pictures, but that's what I get for being unwilling to spend more for a Treo6502) the phone failed to dial two times in two months.

PalmOne Treo 650 JAVOScreen Anti Glare Screen Protector: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"This is a good, thick screen protector that stays solidly stuck to your screen. I don't foresee it peeling...ever. It has a slightly frosted surface to cut down on glare, but the frosting is impossible to see when the screen is on. I've washed mine, it comes out clean as new and the sticky side stays sticky. Just be very careful not to bend it at all or stress it in one place. It is EXTREMELY sensitive to bending and if you bend it, IT WILL NEVER GO BACK. So be extra careful"
PalmOne Treo 650 JAVOScreen Anti Glare Screen Protector: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"Durable, thick, doesn't interfere in any way with the touch screen. I haven't had to wash it yet so I haven't tried out that feature. But I highly recommend it over the other screen protectors and with the low cost of one of these it's been totally worth it to me (hey, after spending hundreds on your Treo what's a few dollars?)"
PalmOne Treo 650 JAVOScreen Anti Glare Screen Protector: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything you've normally seen.  Typically, 95% of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen, hope against hope that you don't have bubbles, but you almost always do. When the screen is off, you see the bubbles, thankfully when the screen is on, the bubbles are pretty invisible..... BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal.  They are thick, and tough, and relatively firm.  And because of those properties, they go on with NO bubbles, and they are easily moveable (adjustable) should you not get it on perfectly the first time.  Further, they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good.  This is the state of the art for screen protectors.  And this all becomes an even bigger issue for men, because of whiskers, over time the screen will get dulled and scratched.  Because of the thickness and quality of these, scratches to the screen are no longer an issue."
USB 2.0 Data Cable for Verizon LG vx8500 Chocolate VX8600 VX9900 enV LX150: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I had it up and running in minutes with my LG VX-8600 (Verizon).  I downloaded BitPM free software to use with the cable.  I just followed the installation instructions that came on the CD that comes with the cable.I clicked on ""discover phone"" in BitPM to have it automatically find the phone.  (I didn't even need to go and look for the com port as the installation says because BitPm scans the ports until it finds the phone)Note..When installing, make sure you pick the right driver.. if you have XP, choose the XP driver, not the NT, or Win98 or other driver.

USB 2.0 Data Cable for Verizon LG vx8500 Chocolate VX8600 VX9900 enV LX150: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Received exactly as stated. My only complaint is in the description- they don't state the length of the cable. My tower for my computer is in another room that I keep at 65 degrees which is maintained constantly. I had to extend this cable by soldering on another 3 feet of wire, as the usb ports that are connected to my computer are mounted on my wall. I projected the cable to be about 6 feet, and if you do yourself, you're in for a surprise. This cable is only about 3 feet long, otherwise everything is fine. One last thing...The description doesn't state this but, the cable actually comes with the drivers for the phone models, which really helped me.On a better note, shipping took a mere two days compared to the six days USPS estimated"

USB 2.0 Data Cable for Verizon LG vx8500 Chocolate VX8600 VX9900 enV LX150: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,Works well.

Cingular 8525 Armor Case - The Metal Case (Black): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I recently purchased the black metal case for my 8525, and have had a few problems w/it.  First the belt clip is kind of small and broke when I tried to clip it to my belt.  Second the aluminum case isn't the sturdiest, so now it's sort of bent (referring to the hinge, I guess I've been really rough on my phone), but I just bend it back to where it's supposed to be (referring to the hinge).  But the case does what it's supposed to do...my phone looks and performs just as the day I got it.  When I informed the vendor that the belt clip broke I just wanted a new clip, instead I recieved a full refund, so that was a pleasant suprise.  I actually liked it so much I bought my wife one when she got her phone"
Sony Ericsson K790a Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"The K790a is currently the best ""Cybershot"" camera phone in Sony Ericsson's lineup (but more are on the way) and also hands-down the best camera phone in the U.S. today.  It's too bad that SE doesn't sell their 5MP and 6MP camera phones stateside.  But the K790a is very capable as a digital camera.  Sure, it's only 3MP, but like many professionals will tell you, pixel count is only one thing.  This 3MP camera-in-a-phone takes better-looking pictures than 5MP and 6MP cameras from Vivitar, Aptech (sp?), Samsung and other offbrand companies.  My main phone is a Sanyo M1 with 2MP and I thought it was pretty good for a camera phone, but when I got the K790a to use with my prepaid SIM card, I was simply blown away by the quality.  (Of course, I bought the phone exactly because I had heard of great things about its picture quality, but the results still far exceeded my high expectations.)  The camera is very easy to use.  I don't care for the MMS features because my prepaid service (Speak Out Wireless) doesn't support them.  I just download them to my PC using a USB card reader.  I wish there were optical zoom (more and more camera phones in Japan, including models from Casio, now have optical zoom) but the truth is of course that if you need serious picture-taking you still use a real digital camera.  But this comes real close to replacing your workhorse digicam.  I'll use this for a year and upgrade to SE's next gen next year, hopefully by then they'll have released optical zoom-equipped K phones.In summary, this is a great camera.  Oh, the phone functions are fine, too.  Reception is pretty good on the T-Mobile + Cingular networks (used by Speak Out Wireless).  Voice is clear and loud.  Really good.  5 stars"

Sony Ericsson K790a Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I've had 3 cell phones prior to this one, all Motorola and I really thought they were all pretty good phones...However I recently just made the switch to my new SE K790a and this one blows them all out of the water! It's very compact and durable you can tell it was made with an incredible level of quality control. I don't think I'll ever go back to Motorola.The camera is a great feature. This is why I bought the phone, now I am never without a camera. The flash is good and strong, so it takes great pictures with good focus.I don't really use the mp3 feature because I have an iPod. I will not comment on this feature. However I was VERY disappointed that it wouldn't allow me to use mp3s as ringtones. I heard this was because my service provider is a jackass and not the phone's fault though. With a little bit of forum browsing I was able to hack my way around this (if you have this problem email me at skibum2801@yahoo.com)... now I have my very own custom ringtones that come out as clear as day with the nice speaker.Call clarity is MUCH better than my other phones. I feel as if I'm simply using my home phone it's so great.The screen resolution is absolutely beautiful. The buttons took a little bit to get used to (because I was a Motorola girl for so long) but I picked it up quickly and now I have no issues.[..."
Sony Ericsson K790a Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,This is a great phone. Pity you cant get a subsidized version via a carrier. Bit pricey but worth it. Great camera and interface. Super easy to upload pictures straight to Flickr via phone.This is a top selling handset in Europe - but tricky to get hold of in the US which is still relatively in the dark ages when it comes to mobile technology
Sony Ericsson K790a Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"Coming from a SonyEricsson T637, I was familiar with the SE UI so getting used to this phone was relatively easy for me. I love the camera, it takes amazing pictures and the music player serves my needs just fine. Support for a memory card is a huge plus (I have a 1 GB Sandisk M2 Micro card) and now I never have to worry about running out of room for music of photos. This phone also allows for extensive customization in terms of shortcuts and themes, ringtones, and so forth, which is another plus. As far as negatives for the phone, I only have a few minor ones: the earpiece volume is somewhat quiet, and the camera lens cover sometimes slides open in my pocket, but neither of these would convince me not to get this amazing phone, it's quite possibly the single best phone I've ever owned! Definitely very happy with this purchase"

Sony Ericsson K790a Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,Pros: - best pictures yet (3.2 mega pixels) on a cell phone that I have used  - built in flash (rare for cell cameras) - cover over lens on camera - good music player - expandable memory with Sony M2 flash memory - fm radio  - bluetooth works great - screen has great size and wonderful resolution - EDGE device makes internet data fairly quick and usable as PC modem (via bluetooth)Cons: - keys are small and difficult to press - camera lens cover needs a lock switch (mine opens just walking around and takes pictures of the lint in my pocket) - very annoying - sleep timer is a bit quick and should be adjustable - I shouldn't expect it thinner since it is the size of a very small digital camera but I'd still like it slimmer. 
Sony Ericsson K790a Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,this phone has all the feature that i wanted. The camera takes really good picture.  Better than all the phone i've seen so far.  The xenon flash really helps taking night pictures.  I use to own the w800i and this one takes way better pictures.  It has auto-focus and other several fucntion that i haven't used yet.  The mp3 player is also very useful.  I love how u can just drag and drop mp3 files to the phone.  It also very easy to navigate through the phone functions.  My computer had no problem recognizing the phone once the drivers were loaded.  it's just like plugging in a flash drive.  The screen is very bright and clear.  The screen resolution is decent.  It's very easy to customize also.  I dl program online to customize the theme.  The battery lasted a lot longer than i expected. Usually last around 3-4 days.The only complains i have about this phone is the headphones.  Walkman series have way better headphones so when you get this make sure to buy new headphones and adapter.  Another complain is the expensive memory stick micros.  I couldn't use the memory from my w800i phone. and i wish they use the sd micros which are cheaper and more widely used
Sony Ericsson K790a Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I have had it since October and it is clearly the best phone I have ever owned.  It has also replaced my camera, and I am now never without a camera.I attend a lot of concerts where cameras are almost always prohibited.  They don't give the phone a second glance, not realizing it's got the 3.2 megapixel capability.  I have got tons of fantastic shots from the last 4 shows.After throwing in a 1GB memory stick (I think it was $79?) it is now storing a half gig of my best music and the display says it will hold 300+ pics right now.The movie function rocks too, however you are going to want to be up very close to the subject.  The sound playback of the movies is fantastic though, so at least concert videos make for good listening.The phone works flawlessly with my PC.  If I throw it on the USB cable, it pops up instantly as another drive, just like the camera.  Just drag on/off the music and pics.  All pics are very nicely numbered and named.If I don't care about viewing the files and just want to move stuff on and off the phone, I don't even take it out of my pocket.  The bluetooth connection allows me to use their software to move things around.Also very cool was that it pops up on my computer as a Modem, which I actually was able to use immediately in my PC Anywhere program.In terms of being a phone, yeah it's great.  The contact list is easy to work with, the call clarity is no issue at all, good signal, no dropped calls, etc. etc. (this is all with Cingular).  Speaker phone works well.It needs charging about every 3rd day, charges very quickly.  Charges slower but with the USB plugged in it also charges.  The only thing I can think to complain about is that when using the USB cable to charge, it only wants to charge it to 89%.  If I want 100% I have to throw it on the real charger for a few minutes."

Palm Treo 600/650 Premium Side Case: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"  I tried one of the Seidio shield holsters but it kept falling off my belt when I got in and out of my car.  The clip just wouldn't grip my belt securely enough.  I gave up after the 3rd time my Treo 650 hit the concrete.  Most of the time I just slip the thing in my left pocket, but that doesn't work so well with some pants - especially jeans.    I decided to try the Treo leather case and I like it quite a bit.  The clip is strong and I find it easy to get the phone in and out of the case. "
Palm Treo 600/650 Premium Side Case: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This is the third case I tried for my Treo 650, and it's simplicity is it's key to success.  My first case had a flapping piece of leather that cost $35 and was totally useless.  My second ""skin"" had a belt clip that whenever I bent over (to tie my shoes, for example) the phone would disengage from the clip and fall on the floor!  Simply bad design. This well designed Premium Side Case is easy to use, easy to wear and gives excellent protection.  When the phone is in vibrate mode, you are always aware when you get a call, page or email.  It's small enough that it's not a problem when worn with a suit, and sits in the right place when driving with a seat belt.  Good design is always fashionable and the case is well made.  I wish it came in brown, I'd buy a second!So if you're looking for the right case... this is it.  You will not be disappointed."
Palm Treo 600/650 Premium Side Case: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I used to carry my Treo 600 with the original case that came with the device. But soon, I found out that the original case is kind of loose and my Treo fell out from it once. Luckily, it was on a carpet so no damage (at least no visual damage). After that incident, I started looking for a better case, and this one is what I found.What can I say, you don't know how bulky Treo is until you wear one on your belt. The case does its job - it provide a nice and secure protection for Treo and it allows you to clip on your belt sideway so you don't have to carry it around with your hand or in you pocket (which barely fit). But Treo is quite heavy and it's thick, so you will definitely aware your Treo is hanging on your belt. And sometime, I just feel like it's too much a burden and I want to get it off me. But overall, I still prefer to have this than the original case. And, the heaviness is not this case's fault, should blame Handspring (now PalmOne) for not making it lighter... :-"
Palm Treo 600/650 Premium Side Case: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"This case is great for protecting my Treo, but the downside is that I have to remove it from the case to use it.I purchased it because I had actually dropped my Treo when walking with it balanced on my portfolio, now I clip it to the  portfolio and it is secure and safe, and I don't run the risk of leaving it behind"

Palm Treo 600/650 Premium Side Case: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,This case does what it is supposed to do... it protects your palm treo phone.  It is very nice looking and durable.  The only negative comment that I will make about the case is that occasionally the memory card gets ejected when taking the phone out of the case due to the snug fit.  That is why I gave it a 4/5.  Amazon has the best price for the case and it is well worth the price

Silicon Skin Protective for Palm Treo 700w 700p (700W / 700P Black): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.  As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the ""thickness"" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.  "
Silicon Skin Protective for Palm Treo 700w 700p (700W / 700P Black): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (GPS car holder), but does do what is was designed to do. Solid grip, and non-slip. Would be nice if it was not so thick"

Silicon Skin Protective for Palm Treo 700w 700p (700W / 700P Black): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow"
USB DATA CABLE for LG VX-8300 / VX-5300 with CD driver !: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,Driver install was easy and Bitpim access works just fine.  The cable I received also charges the phone (VX8300 from Verizon).  
USB DATA CABLE for LG VX-8300 / VX-5300 with CD driver !: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I agree with previous reviewers (Gely + ZenCity) regarding this cable.  The price was right, set up was easy, and (with the Bitpim program) you can communicate with your LG VX8300 efficiently.  I loaded my whole Outlook calendar and contacts into the phone, as well as some songs, wallpapers, and ringtones.  Don't waste your money buying and downloading ringtones or music from Verizon's sites (VCast and such); just hook this cable up between computer and phone and load your phone up with the music/tones that you already own"
USB DATA CABLE for LG VX-8300 / VX-5300 with CD driver !: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This is not an ""all-in-one"" package.  This is JUST the cable and driver.

Bitpim works"
USB DATA CABLE for LG VX-8300 / VX-5300 with CD driver !: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I ordered this cable (two of them actually) to use on the LG 8300.  The driver disc contains software for the 8300 only not the 5300.  Once loaded, it found the phone easily.  I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.  The price of the cable was excellent.  I was unable to locate a data cable locally and was happy to find one on Amazon, even though it was only available through a third party.  All in all, I recommend the product to those in need of cables for the LG 8300.  For those wishing to use it on the LG 5300 please be aware there appears to be no driver included for your phone."
USB DATA CABLE for LG VX-8300 / VX-5300 with CD driver !: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,It worked well with my vx8300. However I already had a driver that I knew worked so I did not use the disc. So I cannot comment on the driver disc

Body Glove Scuba II Cellsuit for Motorola V710 Black/Silver: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I was very pleased when I got this cell phone case. I was really frustrated with my phone before purchasing this case. I kept on getting the screens dirty every time I made a call. Guess I have oily ears or something. No worries now that I have this case.The things I like about this case:1.I think it looks cool -- which ... ok does mean something to me.2.It feels good - it has kind of a rubber feel and the inside is cloth3. It protects my phone - I have two boys and while they are supposed to not touch ""dads phone"" it has an almost 100% chance of getting dropped sooner or later. 4. Its not bulky.5. Fits the phone 95% perfect.The things I don't like:1.Like the other guy mentioned the clear plastic covers the camera a little but not a big deal, camera is not so hot anyhow.2. Earphone spot is awkward. Functional but not perfect.So the GOOD far far outwieghs the bad.  I have no buyers remorse and after surveying the options for the v710 I still think this is the best"
Body Glove Scuba II Cellsuit for Motorola V710 Black/Silver: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Got this a couple weeks ago. The rubber suit covers every bit of the phone so I am confident that I won't be getting any scratched. And it flips open a ok. You can attach the charger and data cable just fine but the ear peice jack seems a little scrunched. You can't access the TF card.There is a strap that goes over the top so your v710 definitely isn't going to fall out.3 minor qualms: The see through plastic has a little glare on it, especially when there is oil between the LCD and the suit. Also, it adds just enough weight that it flips open with a little knock. (noticed this most when having the phone horizontally mounted on my belt). Last, the flap sort of comes into the field of view of the camera. You already know the v710's camera is crap for its specs, but I occasionally have to hold down the little flap. I got used to it real quick"

It feels solid and professionally made, not some cheap ""import special"". I like the blue LED light instead of the typical red dot.Also, the cord is long enough to talk and charge at the same time and at the same time the coil keeps it out of the way when you have the phone down just charging.The IC chip is important so that you don't overcharge your phone battery and shorten it's life.I would buy again. Great price for a quality charger."

The shippment came extremely quick.  Installation was seemless and the drivers from XP worked just fine and recognized the cable immediately.  Downloaded the Nokie suite software from the Nokia site to work with the cable and phone and that also worked just fine.  Cellphone companies wanted 50 bucks for the same cable.  Use this one you will save money and its the same cable

The cable came faster than expected (I find Amazon fulfillment of orders VERY slow). The cable came with the software driver (although I did not need it) and worked great with my already installed Nokia Sync software. Electro Island had the best price by far and the service was excellent. I would definitely use them again

I am very new to all this fancy cell phone stuff, the last one I had was bare bones basic. It is great having a phone that you can do so much with. The camera is so handy since I never remember to take my other camera anywhere with me and the mp3 player and radio are also great to have. The music aspects of this phone are really what sold me on it, I had been looking at seperate mp3 players for awhile now and hadn't made up my mind until I saw this phone and what an awesome deal it was. You just can't beat a one cent phone with free shipping and $75.00 in rebates! T-Mobile had my old Net10 phone number ported to the new phone in 2 days! The customer service people have been so nice and the ability to buy ringtones, wall paper and myfaves icons right on the phone from T-Zones is awesome. I also like that you can check your bill and minutes used and all your account & plan info right on the phone. I am very impressed. The only issue I have been having is finding accessories for it-my usual discount accessory shops don't have much yet-I'm assuming because the phone is so new, but I'm sure that will get resolved soon.

Motorola V360 Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,Dear allI have been using this piece for the last one year and its quite a decent one.It has got all the basic stuff so wonderfully packed. An ample speaker phone and wonderful cam can come handy at times.MP3 player is so gud...but had to purchase an addition mem card.I recently had a problem with handset regarding the voice and this is immediately replaced by T mobile..which makes it trust at ruining times..Thanks for tmobile and amazon...Hope this help
Motorola V360 Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"If you want a cell phone that is well made, looks good, feels good to use and is a really good phone as opposed to a phone and a bunch of other things the V360 is an excellent choice.  It has enough features to keep things interesting but is easy to use and above all is a really good phone that does not sacrifice call quality or battery life to a bunch of useless features that I don't want.  it also looks and feels good and is thus a pleasure to use"
Motorola V360 Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I bought my V360 on eBay and it was sold unlocked/unbranded and it was of the quad-band variety.  Here's my take:PROS:-Durability; this thing was built with the clumsy in mind (like me).  I must have dropped this thing a dozen times and there's barely a scratch.-MP3 player; I agree that the onboard 5MB of memory is a joke, but with the cost of TranshFlash memory coming down (I bought my 512MB chip on eBay for $7.99) then upgrading is easy and affordable.  That being said, the MP3 player is a feature you will actually USE, and the sound quality is good.  I've had no problem with playing my iTunes music (as long as they're mp3 format AND no greater that 192Kbps in quality then it will play fine.) **Media Player defaults to wma and iTunes defaults to m4a formats - you need to convert them to mp3 or change the default in either program to rip to mp3 format (you can change the default to mp3 in the settings menu)-Programmable ""smart keys""; I read where one user complained that the camera button was not on the side, it was the camera icon button on the front keypad.  He must not have known that you can reprogram all of the smart buttons from the ""Personalize"" menu. Not only that, but you can rearrange the menu buttons and program most of the buttons on the face for frequently used apps.  It's a handy little feature.-Built in Bluetooth and EDGE technology.  You may not use these features out-of-the box, but they're for the time when these technologies are more commonplace.  I use my Bluetooth for my wireless headset and for syncing and adding files (mp3's, pics, etc) to my phone with my laptop.-Quad-Band World Phone capable.  This phone works on 850, 900, 1800, and 1900 GSM networks (although that has not been personally tested).  However, I will be traveling to Micronesia and the UK within the year and I'll know for certain by then.CONS:-There's a slight delay when you answer a call - I usually have to say ""hello"" 2-3 times or wait a few seconds before I begin to speak.  I don't know if this is a carrier problem or the phone.  (I use Cingular prepaid).-The light stays on while charging (even when the phone is powered off).  It's annoying.-The onboard memory is a joke.  You really need to upgrade the memory if you want to do anything extra with the phone.-It has a monochrome outer display (full color inside).  This doesn't bother me at all, but it's not as flashy as Razr or other phones.OVERALL:This is a great, durable little phone with handy features I think people will actually use.  I've read where people complain about the picture quality - but that's what a digital camera is for.  If you want a good quality cell phone that's well designed, user friendly, and doesn't look like a tricked-out teenager's phone, then this is the phone for you."

Motorola V360 Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This is a great phone that I've used for a year now.

Just get an adapter for the usb port (a few bucks on eBay) and you can plug in your stereo headphones.  Too bad they haven't offered an update to the Motorola Digital Audio Player.MicroSD slot.  You can take a MicroSD card, put it into the included adapter and plug into an SD slot on your computer and copy MP3s (you can take any mp3 and make it your ringtone, cropping it will make it more effective), 3GP videos (animation looks great, but the sound was slightly out of sync, search the web for video converters to convert your content), or pictures.  I love making my own ringtones and not having to buy them.Bluetooth.  I got an Explorer 320 headset for $20 and it works great with it.Battery.  Easily exchangeable.  Easily slide off the cover and pop in a fresh one.  The battery life isn't very long, so it's good to have a spare battery, they're cheap.Video camera. Not high quality video, but its something the old RAZR couldn't do.Customization.  I love customization.  You can set up the hotkey on the side of the phone, the two on the top of the keypad, and the directional pad to go directly to most functions of the phone.  It even has a shortcut list to list all your favorite features.  You can easily make any picture including pics you take into your wallpaper.  Also you can find replacement faceplates to make your phone unique.Speakerphone.  Works even when closed.  Good for using automated phone menu systems and when you're put on hold.  The speaker is loud and great for ringtones and mp3s.  The plastic may resonate at certain sounds though.Vibrating alert.  VIBE THEN RING!  Why doesn't every phone have this??  It should be the default standard for all phones.  The vibration is definitely strong enough to feel in a pocket.  If you are one to show off your ringtone, let it move onto ring, otherwise be descreet and answer immediately.-----------------------------------------------------------As for what I don't like.  I don't care much for the Motorola menu style.  I prefer Sanyo and Samsung interfaces.  The menu is the same as a RAZR or SLVR.  All the lettering on the outside as well as some case paint has rubbed off.  I carry my phone in my pocket so the phone has aged a bit.  I scraped off the remainder of the lettering so it wouldn't look half worn off.-----------------------------------------------------------All the great features is what keeps me from getting a Samsung t509 or other more expensive phones.  This phone just has all the fee-free features you could want"
Motorola HS805 Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I purchased this for 24.99 and that was a steal ! Pros :-Clear voice clarity.Nice SignalsEasy set up and sync with the phoneruns on NIMH batteries.Cons:-Not a good range.if the cell is in my back pocket jean, the blutetooth set doesnt work well and there is quite a lot signal break up"
Motorola HS805 Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"    I recently purchased this Motorola HS805 headset and find it more than adequate. For the price, it is worth every penny. The ability of using AAA batteries puts it above all other headsets in that respect. Nonreplacable rechargable batteries are a gimmick. Once they finally die, your headset is useless. Too expensive to send away to repair. So you throw your headset and charger away and buy a new one. That is good for a company but not for you.   Depending on your ear structure the fit can be either formfitting or loose. From reading the other reviews here one can infer this. For me it is formfitting. Also you may infer that the Bluetooth telephone or device it pairs to would make a difference in performance. Some reviewers here felt that this headset had low volume or allowed some static. For me and others, we experienced no such problem.    Best bet is to check the return policy if you find that it doesn't meet your standards. But if it works for your device, you have a headset that goes 16 days of standby and 22 hours of talk time on 1 AAA Alkaline battery!. And you will never be bothered with a charger unless you use rechargable AAA batteries which is a pretty good idea. If it also fits your ear comfortably then you have a winner"
Motorola HS805 Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"The battery life on this unit is great. I can use it daily for an hour or so every day, on a single AAA for at least two weeks. (It appears from other reviews that this can vary a lot.)I use this headset with both a Treo 650 phone, and a Apple PowerBook G4. On the Apple, I can use it as a generic output device. (I'm sure the same goes for other headsets.) The signal is strong enough on the Apple to use it from about 30 feet away; on the Treo 650, the signal is not nearly as good.The sound is OK. It's not the best. If it's noisy -- e.g., like driving, or in a hotel room with the air conditioner fan blowing full-blast  -- OR if the person on the other end is not talking very loudly, then it's sometimes hard to hear.It'll drop audio -- i.e., the call goes back to my cell phone -- when the battery is getting low. You can milk it a while longer, but that's really your first clue about the battery.The earpiece is OK; it's not as secure as I'd hope. If you're outside in a gust, you may want to hang on to it.Also, people on the other end sometimes can tell I'm on a headset with this one -- they mention that I sound a little staticky.This is my first bluetooth headset, so perhaps my rating is higher just because it's a nifty gadget. But the battery life on this is really the winner -- my work-mates have rechargeable headsets, and it seems like they're always having to charge them. I use rechargeable NiMH AAA's, and they just last a really long time with this unit"
Motorola HS805 Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I bought this headset for internet chats with my husband, when he travels for business. I find it comfortable to wear and easy to use.  The sound quality is good, volume more than adequate and my husband does not hear any echo.I like the fact that it uses an AAA battery instead of a charger. All you need is a spare battery and no worries about the device dying when the internal battery dies. (Even rechargeables do not last forever.) The ear wrap is comfortable and stays securely on my ear. It would be nice if it bent for a custom fit, but I am pretty happy with it"
Motorola HS805 Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I purchased this headset (...)and the key features I like are as follows:1. AAA Battery - no charging!2. Easy to pair with my phone (Motorola SLVR L7 - European Version)3. No static on both ends.4. Have not had a complaint about ""echoes"" as other reviews stated.5. Price - affordable but acts like an expensive headset.6. Volume is good.7. Fits well, does not feel lose.8. 22 Hours of talk time before battery has to be replaced.I am very happy with it.  I would highly recommend this product for those looking for a bargain and for those that hate to recharge their headset"

Cellet Retractable Car charger for PalmOne Treo 650 / 700 / 700w / 700wx / 680: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This charger is an excellent value. It works beautifully with my Treo 700p smartphone. I love the retractable cable that quickly rewinds inside the device with the touch of a button, making the whole unit quick and easy to store. The only complaint I've heard is that the large, blue power light is too bright at night. It doesn't annoy me, but my wife asks me to turn the device sideways or upside down, so the blue glow doesn't shine up into her eyes. No problem"
Cellet Retractable Car charger for PalmOne Treo 650 / 700 / 700w / 700wx / 680: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,Very nice product. The retractable cord keeps it out of the way and it extends out far enough to use the phone. My complaint with all Palm chargers is that the weak point is at the connector and they break.

"Palm Treo 650, 700w, 700p, 700wx Silicone Skin Case (Purple): Cell Phones & Service",5.0,"This is an excellent product in that it protects my Treo 650 without hiding its style. I chose Treo because of its unique look and excellent features however, the case from Palm didn't work for me because I use the phone a lot and I dont have time to put the phone back in the case everytime.  So, it gets thrown in my purse along with other items which then scratch it.  I also bought a Body Glove case and while I can use the phone while in it, it hides the Treo's real look plus typing on the keyboard with a covered plastic is a drag.  This one seems to even enhance the Treo's style"

Hi-Capacity Li-Ion Cellular Phone Battery for LG VX4400 (LGLI-ABTM): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Good battery life (certainly much better than the old one it replaced).  For the most part it is indistinguishable from the original.  However it doesn't fit quite as snugly in the dock-style charger that came with my phone (not the kind that plugs into the bottom of the phone, but the kind that sits on your desk and contacts the battery directly).  That is a little annoying that it tends to fall out -- if I'm not paying attention I'll wake up the next morning and my phone won't actually have been charged -- but it still works"

Motorola RAZR V3c Pink Phone (Verizon Wireless): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Personally, I think if you are buying any sort of Razr for its ""functionality"" you are buying the wrong phone.  I have personally owned numerous LG phones and while they may not be as small, light, and attractive as Motorola phones, LG phones are built to last. However, if you are just looking for a cute phone that is easy to carry in your purse/pocket and to use just as a nice looking phone, this is a great one to own.I previously had the LG VX9800 before I bought the pink Motorola Razr V3c.  I had the VX9800 because when I was in college I would text people constantly and use the AIM feature during boring classes.  That phone was incredible.  However, now that I am in the working world and basically only use my phone to call people, I wanted a phone that was easier to carry around and was ""cute"".  Enter the Razr.  I don't recommend this phone if your phone is your life--it doesn't do much.  However, if you are just going to be using it to make calls and send the occasional text, it's wonderful.  The pink color that Verizon put out is absolutely gorgeous--it's almost a purpley-pinkish lavendar color.  In my opinion, this pink is prettier than the T-Mobile magenta and much much much nicer than the Cingular pink (I am not a fan of that one at all).In essence, if you're looking for a high-tech phone, this is not it.  If you're looking for a lightweight, attractive phone just to use for calls and some texting, this is a great buy"

It doesn't weakin as did my i1000 battery when charging started at mid range. However, the first time you charge or recharge your Lithium battery is the most important charge of all.

Motorola i530 Yellow Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I love my Nextel i530.  Purchased it almost a year ago now.  I am in northern Ohio and travel many places around the state.  No matter where I have gone, and I take my phone everywhere with me, I have yet to find a place where my phone doesn't have Nextel service.  Also, very durable phone.  I live on a farm here, and we use the two-way often to communicate.  My phone in particular has been dropped several times, once off a grain bin onto concrete 35 feet below, and once also driven over by four wheeler in mud.  Still works like new.  I am extremely happy with Nextel's service and phones.  I know several other people with different model Nextel phones and also can't complain.  I would definitely recommend Nextel over Verizon, Alltel, Cingular, and Sprint.  Other companies have such cheap phones it seems.  It's a shame that Sprint and Nextel merged - from my experience with Sprint, they are terrible with no service anywhere, and their phones suck too"
Motorola i530 Yellow Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I have used the i530 for a little over two years and have had no problems with the unit, or with NEXTEL's service.  To simplify your reading, here is a list of pros and cons.Cons:  A little chunky; Lacks up to date features and tech (such as color screen, external display, etc.); Battery life is nothing to write home about.Pros:  Durability (been dropped off a roof, still going strong); Looks (yellow model); Call quality is excellent; Good speakerphone; Digital 2-way is a great feature.Overall, I am very satisfied with my i530.  The only issue among the cons that is of any real concern is the battery life, but this is characteristic of most NEXTEL phones - perhaps due to the nature of the iDEN network on which they operate.  Even after two years, my original battery lasts more than a day with moderate use.  A pain?  Slightly, but given the advantages of NEXTEL, its worth remembering to charge up more often.  Please beware of several overly negative reviews on NEXTEL posted below - my experience with their coverage, customer service, etc. has been very positive.  Just make sure you do your homework with respect to coverage before you sign up with any wireless company.  Go with the one that gives the best coverage in the areas in which you live, work, or travel.  It's always best to actually put the printed coverage maps to the test with a real phone.  Some providers are overly optimistic.  NEXTEL's maps are pretty legit, at least as far as I have discovered"
Motorola i530 Yellow Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"	For two years now I have not had any problems with my Motorola i530 cell phone, which is serviced by Telus-Nextel.  Over all I would rate the service as good, not excellent.  Rarely I will have trouble getting service in a area where I would normally get a strong signal.  This problem will normally last for roughly under a minute before my phone is once again operational.  I'm a daily commuter  between Canada and the United States.  My phone doesn't miss a beat, it will automatically switch from Telus a Canadian server to Nextel an American server and still have the same great reception.  	The cell phone itself is big, bulky, heavy, and ugly.  It does not come equipped with any of the cool picture or video features.  It does have a direct connect feature so you can use your phone like a walky-talky when talking to a friend with the same option on their phone.  That is neat and fun.  The reception on the phone is clear and crisp, it will seldom cut out of the conversation.  Therefore I did not expect the quality of the sound of down loaded music to be so poor.	What is most impressive is the phones durability.  This cell phone can really take a beating.  I have dropped my phone numerous times.  I have thrown my phone across a room to a friend who failed to catch it more then once.  One of those fancy little phones would have smashed into a million peaces.  On a road trip, my phone had fallen off my lap, out of the car and sat on the side of the road for three days in the rain.  I finally backtracked and relocated my phone.  I had recharged the phone and it worked as expected.  My phone has never let me down, I have always gotten service, and the battery has not died on me thus far.  The battery when fully charged will last for about thirty hours in low to moderate usage.	If you are looking for a quality phone built to with stand punishment and do not desire all of those new phone gimmicks this phone is for you."

"Black Cellet Premium Pouch with Rotating Belt Clip for Palm Treo 600, 650, 700w, 700wx, & 700p: Cell Phones & Service",5.0,"This is the 5th Palm treo case I have bought in the last few years, and it is the best by far.  It holds the treo snugly without the need for a top magnet or velcro flap.  The clip is metal unlike many of the crappy plastic ones that break alot.  It is slim and works great"
"Black Cellet Premium Pouch with Rotating Belt Clip for Palm Treo 600, 650, 700w, 700wx, & 700p: Cell Phones & Service",5.0,"I'm very happy with this case.  I was just looking for a simple belt carrier that would protect my Treo 700p, but would allow complete access to the Treo when I wanted to use it.  In other words, I didn't want something that was attached to the Treo permanently.  This did the trick.  It's simple, but looks good.  Seems to be solidly made as well"
Motorola i560 Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Great phone ... durable and so far dependable.  I did buy a larger battery.  There is one complaint, sometimes the person you call sounds like they are drunk.  I don't know if it is the service or the phone"
Motorola i560 Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I have the i850, but the i560 is what my wife has been using for about 3 months.  The phone is so good, my 2 year old can't destroy it! (he's tried)  There's only 3 things I don't like about it: it doesn't have a very big screen, the external screen isn't color, and it has no camera.  Other than that it's pretty much the same as the higher priced models like the i850... and holding them together I suspect that they in fact have the same electronics inside, minus the 3 things I mentioned above.  If you don't take pic's this really is the phone for you!  You can even submerge this thing in water, and it will still work without needing anything special!  It has GPS built in, and all the java apps.  It's everything the higher priced models have minus the camera and a smaller screen.  Even though the screen is smaller, it's color, and very legible"
Motorola i560 Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"The Motorola i560 is nicely sized, easy to use, and indestructible.  These features are what to look for when looking for a new cell phone.  Not only is the i560 smaller than most bulky Nextel or Sprint phones, such as the i710, but it is the unbreakable model with outside display.  This is something new for the unbreakable model.Size is important, especially with Nextel, because most of their early models are very big and awkward, like the i710.  The i560 is perfectly in between massive and tiny.  This is nice because it is not as vulnerable to cracked screens and antennas.  It is equipped with gripping as well which helps when it comes to using the direct connect, placing calls, and receiving calls.  The i710 has a very smooth exterior.  It is nice looking, but is harder to keep in your hand.  More damage is done to the i710 because there is no gripping.  If, however, the i560 does slip out of your hands, don't worry.  Dropping this phone is not a concern due to extreme durability.  If you are worried about scratching the outside, get a leather or plastic cover for it.The ease of use between the i560 and the i710 is close because they have very similar menu options and simplicity; however, the big difference is in the outside display on the i560.  Without even opening the phone, you can place a call by pushing the stop butt at the top of the phone and scroll through your most recent calls.  This is a safe feature to use in the car.  Speaker phone clarity improved for the i560.  The i710 speaker phone cuts out every third word, where as the i560 is still not perfect in that aspect, but an improvement is better than nothing.  Durability for a cell phone is essential.  There is nothing worse than having to take a cell phone in for repair, or even worse, having to replace it.  As much use as most people get out of their cell phones, how it stands up to daily wear and tear is vital to satisfaction with a phone.  The i560 is one of the unbreakable models from Nextel, and is exceptionally tough.  When the i710 is dropped, it often goes to a blank screen and causes problems with reception and service.  The i560 is completely opposite.  Overall performance, mass, and resilience of the i560 surpasses the i710.  When compared, the i560 is a better choice."
Motorola i560 Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"My previous phone was the Motorola V60i with a monochrome screen with Cingular, so I am still getting used to all the differences in phone capabilities and have barely scratched the surface of what the i560 can do.  Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons so far (after a week).PROS (in order of coolness, best first):1. Nextel's Direct Connect is amazingly fast and their network very clear.  2. Any call, either DirectConnect or regular call can be made with the flip open or closed.  You can scroll through recent calls with the flip closed and call any of them.  3. If you're concerned about radio (RF) radiation - and you should be even though nobody talks about it anymore, this phone has the extendable antenna to get the transmission point further away from you (and improves the transmission).  4. The speakerphone is as loud as you need it to be, even at dinning room table with the TV on and the sound patched through the stereo system (very impressive). There is virtually no lag in the switch between listening and speaking using the speakerphone (full duplex).  You can also turn its volume down to a whisper if you want to. 5. The phone is a little wider than some phones (like the V60), but is very light.  Yet the phone meets the tough Military specs.6. Rubberized grips on the phone make it easy to grip and dial with one hand and phone has a comfortable feel in my medium-sized hand. Phone has slight hourglass shape (wider at the bottom) to fit nicely into the hand.7. Charger charges the battery FAST...MUCH faster than my V60 ever charged.8. Phone has all the standard stuff I love and couldn't live without: voice dialing, custom rings for calls from my contact list, handsfree, long recent calls list (up to 20), ability to store number to Contacts from recent calls (without having to key the number, just have to enter the name). CONS (in order of annoyance, worst first):1. The phone is almost completely made of plastic, and I've never thought plastic was as durable as metal. While Motorola makes truly awesome phones, I worry there might be an over-reliance on plastic to protect the insides of the phone.2. When the phone is in the holster, the outside display is not visible, forcing me to remove the phone from the holster to see who's calling (for those that don't have a custom ring configured) or to check the time.  Very annoying, as I'm used to using my phone as a watch.3. The icons on the outside display are small and those who are overdue for a new eye prescription might have trouble seeing and interpreting the icons.  The only two parts that are clear: the battery (important) and date/time.4. The flimsy port cover at bottom of the phone (where you connect the charger, etc) make me think that someday I'm going to look down there and find it missing. It's easy enough to pop off, but sometimes takes ""persuading"" to put back and have it cover the slot completely (because it needs to be a snug fit to meet the military spec).OVERALL, I really like the phone and highly recommend it to all"
Three Piece Vaule Combo Pack for RIM Blackberry 8100 Pearl: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"The cover design is well made based on the requirements. The problem according to me is the device not be able to avoid the dust on the LCD screen because of the openings on both the sides. In my opinion, compared to all other covers, this is a simple design and will allow you to easily insert and remove the BlackBerry out of the case"
Brand New Samsung MM-A900 Extended Battery w/ Door (1200 mAh): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I've had the battery for about a week now. Simply love it. I'm a heavy user of GPS Applications and Power Vision for web-surfing on the go. I used to charge the phone twice a day, now I charge it once a day and sometimes I even forget to plug it in at night and I still have 2 bars of battery left half way through the day. Even when i forget to charge it hasn't died on me.This is a great deal at $16 + shipping vs. the one sold at Sprint stores for around $60"
Brand New Samsung MM-A900 Extended Battery w/ Door (1200 mAh): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,I'm very happy with this purchase overall.  This battery is a huge improvement over that ridiculous battery that comes with the phone. Talk time and internet time are increased greatly.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because bluetooth eats this battery pretty fast.  Though that is still better than the original battery.  It may just be the phone. I have no idea if it is as good as the one Sprint sells for 60 dollars.  It is definitely worth 20 bucks all day long
Brand New Samsung MM-A900 Extended Battery w/ Door (1200 mAh): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I just bought this battery at a Sprint Customer Service store, and I paid $64.64 with tax in California.

Brand New Samsung MM-A900 Extended Battery w/ Door (1200 mAh): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"Going from charging my phone a couple times a day to charging it once every couple days has definitely changed by opinion of my A900, making it less high-maintenance and allowing me to do some web browsing, headset using, and general multimedia mayhem without the constant paranoid fears that this fooling around will cost me when the OEM battery decides to die at the most inopportune time.  Quite a cheap price for the freedom and peace of mind.  It's been 12 hours and the thing has yet to change from 3 bars.  What!?  Aside from the piddling cost of this battery (which is about double the tax you'd pay on a battery at a Sprint dealership), there is the tax of the bulge it creates on its backside.  To me, this is not insignificant, but is ignorable, as it doesn't detract from the aesthetics of the phone and it provides a way to grip it when dialing, talking, or using the buttons"
Brand New Samsung MM-A900 Extended Battery w/ Door (1200 mAh): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"The only complaint I had about my a900 was the battery life.  I am on conference calls a lot and use my bluetooth headset which tends to drain the battery pretty quickly.  With this extended battery I am able to use my headset without having to charge the phone repeatedly.  Totally worth the $15, plus it arrived in about 4 business days with standard shipping"
Brand New Samsung MM-A900 Extended Battery w/ Door (1200 mAh): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"The Samsung A900 is a great phone - a Motorola Razr on steroids. (That is, it's much more durable than the Razr.) BUT THE BATTERY LIFE IS AWFUL!!!  You literally have to charge this phone at least two times per day to get any real talk time.NOT ANY MORE!  The Bargaincell price was so low, I was skeptical.   PERISH THE THOUGHT!  I got the battery on time; it was VERY well packaged.  It fit the phone PERFECTLY, as did the COVER it came with.I plugged it in and let it charge completely.  I then used the phone for THREE DAYS without a recharge!  WHOO HOO!!!!  BRAVO BARGAINCELL!BY THE WAY - Even though this is a somewhat ""thick"" battery, it is  SURPRISINGLY UNOBTRUSIVE: It does NOT add the ""bulk"" you might think, looking at its picture.  In fact, I think the phone actually looks BETTER with the larger battery.  I have a leather Bytech carry case designed for the Razr/A900.  It's a tight fit now, but I'm sure the case will stretch much like a new shoe does after it's been worn a few days.DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY ONE OF THESE BATTERIES!!"
Brand New Samsung MM-A900 Extended Battery w/ Door (1200 mAh): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"The samsung A900 Blade is an excellent phone. I can say so many good things about it. The only bad thing about it I encountered is the horrid battery life. And the battery life was a problem from the second I walked out of Sprint. Nobody wants to charge their phone between 2-4 times a day. With the standard battery in the A900 I was charging my phone a ridiculous amount of times. But that's what you get with a razor thin phone. So of course I searched and finally found this battery which was crucial. This battery is a life saver. Be sure to get this one because it was the cheapest I found, and I did extensive searching. Also this one comes with the door which is very crucial. I've seen some extended batteries being sold without this door and I almost made the mistake of buying one without the door. You would be screwed without a door that fits the extended battery. What would you do, put a rubber band around it? Heck no. Well anyway, now that I have this battery, my phone will last all day without worries of dying just like my previous models that had thick batteries. My A-900 is still very thin even with this extended battery that sticks out a little. Don't worry, you're phone will still look great with this battery and you will enjoy all it's features without dying"
palm Treo 680 PDA Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I initially had the same lousy battery life that a lot of people complained about,until I applied the FIX: Palm has identified that the Treo 680 device can experience reduced battery life when the camera is used. The camera may continue to draw power from the battery when the device is in standby mode. Treo 680 users should install the Treo 680 Camera Update to address this issue.[..."
palm Treo 680 PDA Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I have gone through several smartphones in the past 4 months (Including, Cingular HTC 8125, and Nokia E62)  and can safely say that this is the best phone I have owned.   The Palm operating system is much easier to use than the Windows operating system ( albeit, less powerful) and much more customizable and synchronization-friendly than the Symbian OS.  Its great for easy installation of software.Pros:- Very customizable interface, making the phone very user friendly. You can set any application or any number to dial as a preset button. - Palm OS is easy to use, and thus, you actually get to take advantage of the many features of the phone, unlike Windows Mobile, which is definantly more powerful than Palm OS, but cumbersome and difficult to use at times. - You can use this as a one handed phone...very important for people like me who like to drive and text/email. - Perfect size, weight and feel of the phone in your hand and on your ear. The lack of the antennae stub on this model is a huge aesthetic improvement.-  Easy synchronization with your Outlook mailbox or with the Palm Desktop - Can set the phone to automatically retrieve your emails and alert you, which is very useful  (although limits battery life) Cons:- Battery life is somewhat worse than other phones.  I have to charge my phone every night, and I probably use about 15 minutes of internet, 30 minutes of mp3 player, autoretrieve email every 30 min,  and 2 hour talk time as well as some other Palm functions.    If you have it set on auto-retrieve for your email, the battery life seems to decrease impressively.    The newer manufactured 680s have a fix installed for this problem apparently.- You cant plug in your own headsets into the device ( like your iPod headphones)  you have to use a specific headphone that fits and you can get it from Palm. I hate that. I suggest buying this phone unlocked from Palm, instead of from Cingular.  I got it for 350$  with a 1G SD card and stereo headphones included. Also,  if you get it from Cingular, they always ruin the look of the phone by plastering their logo all over both sides of the phone.  OVERALL:  extremely satisfied with this easy to use, highly customizable, powerful smartphone, despite a somewhat shorter battery life. "
palm Treo 680 PDA Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I had a Palm TX which I loved, but didn't like having to go to WiFi sites for the web. I also had a Moto V557 phone which is the best cell phone I've ever owned.  I purchased the Treo for the best of both worlds.I like the Treo 680, but I had to read all of the instructions, call customer service and practice using certain features to not be frustrated with the phone.  For example, I had difficulty answering the phone using the touch screen and had to practice pressing the small send button. (Which I usually missed while in a rush to answer the phone.)I like the web because it's fast enough that I don't miss the WiFi.  I had to get used to the fact that many web sites aren't small enough for the phone, but it's excellent for using Google maps, looking up business and giving the number for easy dial (just tap the blue line), checking bank accounts, online orders, movies, weather and especially the news.  Email is good too with the Palm software. I didn't use Express or GetGood email.  I absolutely love the chat setting on the messaging.Now, the phone is another story. I miss the ease of dialing a traditional cell.  My Bluetooth does not work well with the 680. People typically tell me that they can't hear me so I now use a corded ear bud.  The Bluetooth doesn't work with the voice dial feature that is purchased separately.  You can't insert hard pauses with phone numbers that require you to dial extensions.  There is no way to delete one digit at a time if you misdial a number.  You have to leave the phone dialing page and return to redial.  The phone dials slowly if there are other programs running. And lastly, you can't check your calendar or other features after answering the phone if the key pad was locked when you answered the phone. You have to hang up with the person, unlock the phone, check the calendar and call them back.The battery life is poor, but I keep a charger in the car which helps a great deal.All in all, I love my Treo 680. I have purchased additional software that I strongly recommend. They are: Launcher X(excellent), Mobil Write, Treo Voice Dialing, The Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus, Scrabble and Mars Needs Cows.I also recommend that you keep you Treo locked with a security password.  I have not found a carrier that will offer insurance on this $400 phone"
palm Treo 680 PDA Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"When I first got my phone, I was quite excited.  It had more memory than my current Treo 650 however only after one day I noticed the battery life was draining much faster than I had anticipated.  From my research, I discovered a few things that needed to be done before I extend my battery life to more than 10 hours.1)I had to apply a camera patch since my phone was manufactured prior to Jan 18th.  This patch can be found on Palm support site.2) I needed to completely drain my battery until there was nothing then charge it for 24 hours.Once I did these two things, my phone has lasted for a few days without a charge, and I've set my versamail to retrieve messages when they arrive.  This is a big plus for me going from getting emails every hour to getting them when they arrive.I've had no problems with any of my SD cards or mini-SD cards.  The increase internal memory also helps since I use my TomTom navigation with my Treo.  I've heard the various complaints, but you have to work through some of them.  it is a great phone"
palm Treo 680 PDA Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Upgrading from the Treo 650, it is true that there isn't much new. Also issues such as the horrible battery duration and non-megapixel camera leave one frustrated. But the fact remains that the Treo 680 is one of the best smartphones on the market, particularly if you want good PDA functionality or are a PalmOS devotee.So I accept the current Palm reality and adapt by buying 2 additional batteries. Not elegant, but it works. That doesn't mean that I won't tell Palm ""Guys get your act together and come out with something far better!"
Samsung WEP200 Wireless Bluetooth Headset - Great for Cell Phones (Black): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I needed a bluetooth headset because of all of the driving I do in traffic but I didn't want to look like a dork with some giant blinking contraption sticking out of my ear. I took a chance on this headset even though I read a review saying that it didn't sync up well with the VX8300. I couldn't be more happy. Even though it is small(about 1-1/2"") the buttons are still large enough to use with ease. It also fits snug and comfortabe in my ear and works well with my VX8300."
Samsung WEP200 Wireless Bluetooth Headset - Great for Cell Phones (Black): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"the headset is great, works really well with my samsung phone...the only problem i have with it is sometimes its hard to make it stay in my ear, but its really great and i would buy it agai"
T-Mobile Dash myFaves Smartphone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"Well I read through just about every review prior to purchasing this phone and was almost thinking twice about it after reading some of the reviews here, but I decided to take the plunge and go for it.  Well I'm glad I did.  All I can say is this phone has been a pleasure to use from the get-go.  It has its flaws but what phone doesn't?  The question is whether you're going go flip out over an alarm clock or volume strip or is it a trivial issue for you.  Most of the gripes others have had just seem little to me.  Let's talk about the pros and cons:Pros:1. Call quality is excellent. No static what so ever.  No dropped calls.  My area has good T-mobile coverage so I can't complain.  As a phone it does what it's supposed to do.  Make good quality calls.  It also pairs with my bluetooth headset (Plantronics 510) really well.  Speaker phone is of good quality too.2. Internet works great. I have the $5.99 plan and yes EDGE isn't the fastest but it gets the job done.  It doesn't matter where I'm at I can check my email, finds restaurants or directions, or just surf the web when I'm bored.  It really came in handy when I was out on vacation and lost.  WiFi works well too.  Didn't want to fork out the money for hotspots though.3. The camera at 1.3 megapixels is decent quality.  No it's not going to replace my regular camera but I found it really handy when I forgot to take my camera to my friend's wedding, but was still able to take quality pictures.  I haven't tried videos yet though.4. Mp3/Video player: Now the speakers on this phone aren't the greatest so I wouldn't use them for listening to music but when plugged into a headset it sounds pretty good.  I bought a 2GB microSD card bought here at Amazon and now I can hold a ton music and movies.  Videos looks pretty nice I'd have to admit.  This thing is my travelinig entertainment center.  I even found a way to play original nintendo games on this thing and have been trying Mike Tyson's Punchout like back in the old days.5. Calendar/schedule: I had a PDA but for some reason I'm more compelled to actually use my calendar and keep my schedule on this thing than I did with my Pocket PC.  Probably because of convenience reasons.6. Smartphone applications: I'm in the medical field and I keep all my medical applications on this phone.  I can quickly look up drug references or research diseases.  I really thought I'd need a touchscreen in order to better navigate these programs and while it might be slightly easier with a stylus, I don't find that it's all that necessary and still navigate pretty well. I just wish the processor were slightly faster for some of these apps, but it's more than adequate. And I'm not sure why people don't think there are a lot of programs for the smartphone.  Programs written for WM5 are compatable with PPC as well as smartphones equally. [...].7. Appearance: Everyone who sees this phone absolutely loves its looks and so do I.  It looks great and feels great.  I saw this side by side with the Motorola Q and the Q just looked so much bulkier and...well... not as nice.  The rubber backing feels awesome.8. Battery: For all that I use this phone for it makes it through the day with plenty battery to spare which is all I can really ask for.  I wouldn't go 2 days without charging the battery though. You should charge it every night.Cons:1. Windows Mobile 5: Mighty Microsoft needs to write a cleaner program. However Windows Mobile 6 is on the way and will be free to download for T-Mobile customer soon so hopefully that'll take care of some of the problems.  I swear just to turn on the bluetooth and pair up my bluetooth device takes me a whole minute just because of how hard it is to navigate WM5.2. Volume strip: Yeah like everyone says it sucks.  I disabled mine.  Adjusting the volume with this thing is tedious at best.  Luckily my music/video programs as well as my stereo headset allow me easier ways to adjust the volume so it's not such an issue for me.3. Alarm clock: Now I don't use this all that much but I see what everyone says about it and yeah it's a pretty idiotic written program.  However rather than writing half a page on how bad it is I downloaded a free one from the internet that works great so my life now goes on.Summary: So I use this device to make quality phone calls, surf the web, check email, play games, listen to music, watch movies, monitor my schedule, check my medical references, and take decent quality pictures.  All this thing needs now is a laser beam that will cut through metal and it'd be the greatest gadget known to man"
T-Mobile Dash myFaves Smartphone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I was carrying a PDA and a Razr cell phone. When I got this phone I gave my PDA to my brother and my Razr to my daughter. I love the full contact list with addresses, all the phone numbers and notes that are in my Outlook and it syncs with Outlook. The calendar is really nice and that too syncs with Outlook. I don't try to use it for browsing the internet, but I do use T-mobiles T-zones to collect all my email from all my various email address types. It took some learning to find the easiest way to get to everything, but it's there is you look, called and received numbers with one key press, extremely easy contact look up and my favorite applications stay on the screen so that they are only a push or two away. It has EVERYTHING that any cell phone has and works as well or better and easier. The speaker phone is great and one touch (or speed) dialing is great. I can store hundreds of phone numbers at numbers I choose, then use the spot number to make a call instead of looking up numbers (ie: Lee's cell is spot 5, home spot 15, office spot 25) I found a message board especially for the DASH and that helped me learn a lot about the phone. Coverage with T-mobile is as good as any. Some areas I have service where friends with other providers don't and some areas they have service I don't. All in all, I find that I have service across the country without much trouble and I drive. If you have T-mobile cell service, their t-zones for email and many other internet based services is only $5 and WiFi service is only $20 (monthly), can't beat that. The full keyboard makes text messaging and keeping notes MUCH easier and more fun. It's not a full PDA, but it does everything I did with my PDA. It's way more than a phone, really small and thin, easy to carry, easy to lock and unlock the keyboard. It takes nice pictures for emergencies if I don't have my camera and it uses a mini SD card, which I have installed and use to store pictures and videos. Personally, I can't think of a negative thing about it. It's not a laptop computer, but I think it's the best cell phone on the market. My cousin has the blackberry and he's jealous of me and my Dash"
T-Mobile Dash myFaves Smartphone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I've had multiple PDA's that have crashed and multiple phones in the past.  I had a great Nokia phone, but wanted to combine into one unit so I decided to try the Dash about 6 months ago.  So far, I've had no issues with service.  Been able to make and receive phone calls, call clarity is excellent and with TMobile, I have service in my office unlike other co-workers phones.  Everyone is jealous - their pda phones are much larger and not as nice looking.  I really enjoy having the email and internet feature.  The only issue I've had at all is with the volume control - when I'm surfing the net or playing ball breaker, I hold the phone and often hit the volume control.  Everything else works as described and I'm very happy with my choice.When I was looking to combine my phones, I was comparing this phone to the blackberry and after reading many reviews, I picked this one.  I'm very happy I did.[..."
T-Mobile Dash myFaves Smartphone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"This is my first SmartPhone and I've had a lot of fun with it so far.  For being so small, the keys are remarkably easy to use.  I often connect it to my laptop via a USB cable.  If you have Windows XP along with MS ActiveSync 4.2.0, your PC/laptop will recognize it as a network device.  A little bonus app on the Dash lets you share the Internet connection (granted you have the data plan) at no extra cost.If you get the add-on micro SD card (about $80), you'll have no need to buy an iPod.  Windows Media Player (which comes standard) works just as well.It has a built in 802.11b (or g?) card.  When I'm in range of wi-fi, I can use Skype and save my minutes.  I hope T-Mobile doesn't read this since they'll probably patch that loophole :)A few of the cons:-There is no scroll wheel like on the Blackberry.-The battery charge doesn't last longer than a day or so if you've got data push to Outlook enabled.  If I forget to charge it at night, I'm SOL.-The volume strip on the righthand side drives me nuts.  I'm constantly hitting it by mistake.  When I do, an annoying popup interrupts whatever I'm doing.  You can disable the volume strip, but it's kindof important for certain apps like Skype and Windows Media Player.  A simple classic volume dial on the side would be a huge improvement.  The strip never seems to work right when I really intend to adjust the volume.-The keyboard is nice, but a touch screen would be better for certain apps.  There's no way to cut-and-paste"
T-Mobile Dash myFaves Smartphone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I have tried many many cell phones but this phone is unbelievable. I put a 1 gig memory card in it. Right now, I have a 140,000 word dictionary on it, the NIV bible, Star Wars, many videos of my son, about 100 wma songs, and a ton of pictures. It syncs up to MS Outlook like a charm so all of my contacts, appts, tasks, and emails are always up to date. It comes with bluetooth and works great with my logitech headset. It also has wifi which has been flawless with my wireless network and is very speedy. The screen is absolutely gorgeous. The camera takes decent pictures and video. One of the best features is the battery life. For all it does it lasts an incredibly long time. I have not found a smartphone that even comes close to these features especially for the price. I like it waaaay better than the treo, blackberries, Q, or any other qwerty device. It's glued to my hip and I use it all the time. I love it!!"

Sony Ericsson W710i Performance Graphite Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"After trying this phone out a few days here are my personal resultsPros1. What attracted me to this phone were the fitness features, flip phone design and the rugged design. So far I like the pedometer/running tools. You have to calibrate it manually if you want the best results, but right out of the box it's been okay so far. 2. I've had other mp3 cell phones (LG VX8500 Chocolate, Samsung SCH-A930, Motorola SLVR L7) and this one blows all of the others out in this category. Granted this is not going to contend with the iPod but for a cell phone the Walkman abilities are impressive.3. User Interface. By far the cleanest and most intuitive I've used. But then I guess almost anything is an upgrade over the Verizon OS.Cons1. I can't stand the armband that came with this. The length of the headphones cord is way too long for running, at least for me personally. It's taken me a few times to figure out something comfortable in terms of cord management.2. Button layout. My hands aren't big by any means but I still have trouble with some of the dedicated buttons (Walkman, Internet, Shortcuts, Power On/Off). 3. 2 Megapixel camera. I said I don't use the camera feature often and i'm glad I don't for this camera. This has the be the most stripped down, barebones 2 megapixel camera I have used. Overall I must say that I am satisfied with my purchase; I'm still tyring to figure out some of the features on this phone. I had the choice between this and the W810i for the same price at the Sony Store and I opted for this one because of the flip phone style and fitness features and I must say that these two features haven't let me down yet, otherwise I would've gone for the W810"
Sony Ericsson W710i Performance Graphite Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"So I welcome myself to the more powerful world of the Cell Phones.  I've been a fan of Sony Ericsson's phones after I've seen what they really do and when I had the Z500a long time back when I won the phone during hurricane season, I thought the phone was great.  My only thoughts were that despite the phone being a Flip Phone and having a ""Music Player"" that the phone only had 15MB of space to begin with and to top it off, its camera wasn't great.  Thanks Sony for your answer.I have already made a few quick station buttons on the W710 and the best part is that I feel original with the fact that I'm the only one that has it in my school and among my friends.  Most people I've seen the only chance they have is getting the W810 and while that phone looks ok, the W710 just fits me right.  The phone's color scheme, the style of the phone, the phone's technogeekness (for those of us who love technology), and the fact that many people (namely the girls) find it a cute phone (Don't know weather that is good or not, but at least it attracts some attention).  The fact that the phone's user interface is for the most part the same as every phone from SE, it makes it that much easier to learn the phone's buttons and it is a huge upgrade from my old Z500.  With 2GB of expanded memory that I put in it and the phone's already 17MB of internal space, the phone has many possibilities!  And the last part before I go is that with the fact its an Active phone, you can be sure to check how many steps you do during the day, check your training, and more! It even gives you rewards for being active.So for those needing a nice looking phone, want walkman power for mp3's and FM Radio, knowing your fitness activity, this is the phone for you"
Sony Ericsson W710i Performance Graphite Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"Note:  I am transitioning from using the Sony Ericsson P910i smartphone so my review is based on how well the w710i's features work in comparison. I purchased this because I go to remote areas and the P910i needs heavy bandwidth in order for the phone to function.  My son's Z500 would work in areas my p910i would not. Review is based on 1 week of usage.I've also purchased the z710i for my son and will review that one later.Strengths: *Improved picture quality of 2.0 megapixels vs. 1.3*Excellent voice quality with headsets (wired or bluetooth)*Text, SMS, MMS*shortcut buttons to quickly use 4 of your most used features*Battery life is outstanding*mp3 player*RSS reader*Bluetooth synchronization of files*Ability to set up phone in non-english languages*Ability to buy an international SIM card to avoid extra fees*Sync cord charges the battery*Can double as a modem via bluetooth or usb cable (if you don't have unlimited internet package be very careful as they charge big $$$)*FM radio - reception is so-so in the downtown area*standard or flight mode option to use while on airplane*Edge technology - my p10i did not have this.  I can download email extremely quickly now!!!*step counter & calories expendedNeutral: *The international charger with an adapter for US outlets.  It is very wobbly in the outlet.  I'll invest in a US version.*Inability to sync with any computer using Windows Vista (I'm sure a workaround is coming)*I haven't used the armband yet but it may improve the stepcounter's accuracy.*Others have warned about holdling the phone and interferring with the antenna, I haven't had a problem with this.*Over-the-ear earbuds don't fall out!Weaknesses: *Since I have other Sony phones, I am disappointed that they have changed the shape of the connection for the sync and charger.  Translation, you can no longer use the current chargers of the previous generation phones. *There is no way to charge the phone and use the wired headset. You either listen to the radio or charge the phone.* You can not use the standard over-the-counter headsets because there is no outlet for it.*Need to switch settings to view more than one email account*Yet another memory card format (micro)another adapter needed*Memory card only 512mb (can purchase 1 or 2gb)*picture caller id only works after you open the phone (edit March 21,2007 - if you have answer on open set)I purchased my W710i from an internet company for $254.00 and it was shipped directly from Hong Kong in 2 business days. I'm unsure if I can provide their name here.Overall: Sony has always produced quality products. I love this phone and it is a very good comparison to a SmartPhone. I do miss using my styllus.  If you don't need the bells and whistles of a smartphone, go for the Z710i as it is a bit cheaper but a great contender.If I could rate it more than 5 stars, I would even though I haven't tried all of the features of this phone.  Buy it without hesitation!ADDENDUM March 5, 2007I dropped the phone on a tiled bathroom floor.  When it hit, the clip, battery cover and battery scattered in different directions on the floor.  Amazingly, the phone still operates.  The damage is a barely noticeable mark on the upper left of the phone.  A mark like that could happen in my purse!I am really impressed now but hope I never do that again!"

Motorola KRZR K1 Phone (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,I received my phone and everything was good.  When I looked at my bill Amazon did not close out my previous 2 months I had left on my contract with Cingular.  So Cingular tried to charge me some liquidation fee of $30.  I called and had it removed
Motorola KRZR K1 Phone (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,I have only had this phone for a few days now but I have used every feature it has to offer. I must say that this is the best phone I have ever owned. The only real problem I have is that my fat fingers sometimes hit buttons I didn't intend but it's really not that big of a deal; I just need to re-train my hands. I am happy with the picture quality as well as video quality. The audio options are great for me as all I really wanted to be able to do is load my own songs on to use as ringtones and Motorola made this a pretty simple task
Motorola KRZR K1 Phone (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This phone is incredible, and I'm so happy I bought it through Amazon...very good deal and smooth transaction! I definitely recommend getting this phone. Here's my run-down of it:Pros:Excellent voice qualityExcellent sound qualityGreat reception...even in places that were ""dead zones"" with my other phones.Very compact and oh so sexy sleekDecent battery life (MUCH better than RAZR)Easy to follow menuCons:Front side is a fingerprint magnet from hellSmall screenNo warranty available with CingularOnly a few backgrounds & ringtones to choose from without downloading your ownI also bought the data cable package through Amazon, and it worked beautifully from the first try."
Motorola KRZR K1 Phone (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I have been using my KRZR for a few weeks now and it has exceeded expectations. I will try to touch on some things not commented about so much in other reviews...Music portability, awesome. With the cable that came with my girlfriend's V3i I have had very little trouble transferring music from my laptop to the phone. There is a disclaimer in the manual saying some copyrighted songs may not transfer, blah blah blah, but there have been only very few songs with any problem. I have transferred 60 songs so far onto a 2GB mico card I bought and it has been great. The KRZR has powerful little speakers that put out a great sound volume and quality for the size. Playlists will also continue to play when the phone is closed, which I found a very nice and convenient touch. I re-upped on an existing Cingular contract and I have also noticed increased signal reception, which is nothing to sneeze at considering I went from a Nokia 7610 to the KRZR, so I didn't have some POS crap phone prior to the KRZR. As with RAZRs, you have to be careful not to hit the internet button (i wish you could lock keys like on Nokia), but I found getting the Motorola horizontal pouch pretty much took care of that. Overall a great phone. I wish Motorola provided you with a disk full of programs INCLUDED with the phone like I was able to get with my Nokia 7610, but that is really neither here nor there in a review of the phone itself. Some have commented on having trouble with the buttons on RAZRs and KRZRS, but for an average size guy with average sized hands, this has not been a problem at all. SO FAR, SO VERY GOOD"
Motorola KRZR K1 Phone (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I just received this phone free as part of Verizon Wireless's ""New Every Two"" program.  My main gripe with the phone is that, unlike my former phone (Motorola V265), it cannot be set to display the time in the 24-hour format (I do not use am/pm).  Otherwise, the screen is nice and bright, it's easy to use, it's much less bulky than my former phone, and the voice activation is easier"

Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I've used this model headset for 6 months, and the sound quality is great. I drive a truck for a living, and needed a headset with low backgound noise from the truck. The ""windstop"" technology works good. I wear it about 6-7 hours a day. The earpiece can be straightened slightly to minimize discomfort. Only problem is it disconnects sometimes at ""rest"". It beeps when it disconnects, and reconnects automatically, usually within a minute or two. Would (and have) recommended to friends"
Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I purchased the Logitech Mobile Traveler a little over a year ago and have been extremely satisfied with the product, but that's not to say that that the product is not without some flaws.  The reception, clarity, and battery life is quite good.  Also, my hearing isn't the greatest and love the fact that you can turn up the volume on this unit and don't have to strain to hear.  My one complaint about the product is that the loop piece that fits over the ear came after after the first month of use and often separates from the unit.  I've gotten used to the drill of reattaching the loop prior putting it on, but it's still very annoying at times.  Even with this slight annoyance, I would definitely buy this product agai"

I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.  As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the ""thickness"" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.  "

This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow"

It also feels a bit light in the bottom when you hold it open in your hand.. almost a hollow feel. But other that that this is a pretty cool little phone with a 2MP camera. It also seems to get really good reception as another reviewer has stated. The antenna is in the loop on the phone so you have to get use to not covering it with your finger. The way the phone is shaped you want to hold the phone with your index finger convering the loop which can lose reception...so you just have to remember that when talking to someone. The inside screen is really really bright! I turned it all the way down to save the battery and the phone is still bright like a normal cell.

That was nice of them... i'm kind of bummed that that charge feature doesn't work on my phone (D807) but that's just an issue with my phone I guess and nothing with the product.
USB Data Cable For Samsung Cingular 3G SYNC A707 BlackJack i607 Trace T519 T809 T509 D800 D807 T629: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I like this for more than one reason...so read on,Reason #1 - It keeps on charging your cell phone when you are transferring data, trust me this helps, when you are transferring 1 GB of data you will loose reasonable amount of battery charge on your cell phone. Reason #2 - Only data that can be played by your cell phone gets transferred, so this way you will know before hand that all the data you transferred will actually play when you are in the back seat of your car.You will have to use windows media player to sync this phone (Samsung Sync SGH-A707) in order to transfer files. MP3 and WMV/WMA formats work with this phone, i do not know whether other formats work or not.Let me explain in brief how to sync this phone with windows media player. Connect one end of the cable to your phone first and the USB end to your computer USB port (Preferably USB 2.0). If you have already inserted media card into the phone you will see two drives named samsung phone and samsung media card when you open My Computer on your computer. Now open Windows media player, you will be able to see the following tabs just below main menu. From left to right you will be able to see in this order - Now Playing, Library, Rip, Burn, Sync, and Guide. Click on Sync. Make sure your Cell phone is connected, now you will see two halves in the same window, left half is for you to drag and drop your file that needs to be transferred and right half is where it goes (your cell phone name apears on the top), usually windows media player prepares to transfer the file, this takes a while. Also just above the right window in the drop down box make sure you select Samsung media card, as the Samsung phone option has very limited memory.Once you are well versed with what your phone can play, i would recommed copying files to your MicroSD using a USB reader/writer as windows media player takes time preparing the windows environment for sucessful transfer, this saves you a chunk of time and battery power."

Silicon Skin Protective for PDA Palm Treo 650 700w 700p (9 Color to choose from for each model) (700p Orange): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.  As others have noted, it does increase the thickness somewhat (but certainly no less than leather cases, etc).  But the ""thickness"" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.  "

Silicon Skin Protective for PDA Palm Treo 650 700w 700p (9 Color to choose from for each model) (700p Orange): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow"
Motorola Moto Q Dual Pocket Desktop Charging Station: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"If you own a Q, you know the battery life with the standard battery is horrible.  This charger also has a slot for a 2nd battery, which is great. So I can charge my phone with the standard battery, and have the extended one Verizon sells in the back slot. Never having to worry about battery life again. Also, it makes a wonderful stand for the phone, and when hooked to the USB cable, you get data conectivity too.  Only downside, it won't charge the extended battery until the phone is fully charged."
Smartphone 2.5mm to 3.5mm Stereo Headphone Adapter (2-Pack): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"Many people are having issues with the 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm adapters and Treos.  This adapter works FINE in my Treo 650. The plugs fit fine (I got the 2 pack) and I get STEREO sound through both headphones. If you do not have headphones with the proper impedance you will NOT get stereo sound. My crappy Panasonic headphones and better Sony (isolation) headphones work fine with this adapter. Maybe I'm just lucky, but for this low price, this adapter is fine. If you want sterling sound you shouldn't be listening to mp3 anyway. I can hear the limitations of my files on the treo, so it's clearly good enough"

Palm Leather Side-Loading Case - Handheld carrying case: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"Holds the phone in an attractive, snug, leather case!  Clips to belt and holds tight.  Since the phone is horizontal and not vertical, I don't have trouble catching it on things.  I've broken the clip on several cases getting in and out of the car.  The phone would catch on something and the plastic clip would snap.  This case works great and eliminates that problem!  The perfect solution"
Motorola Slvr L6 L2 Silicon Skin Case - Smoke: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"This case is made for an L6. The L2 uses the same case, so they both fit within this rubber case. However, the keys are laid out differently on the L6 - so this case has the grooves slightly off on the keys. I didn't give it a low rating, because it's well built and is actually a really great product - just wanted to give  other L2 owners a warning. It works well, but it's just a little funky on an L2, but totally usable. For the price, you just can't beat it - and it's a much better option than watching your phone pop into 2 or 3 pieces each time it falls out of your pocket"

Logitech Mobile Freedom Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"After about a year, the ear support on this Bluetooth headset broke.  Bad news.

Logitech Mobile Freedom Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"Works great, its a bit bigger than some headsets, but in this case I feel thats a good thing, the microphone does a lot better job filtering out background noise and you don't get a feedback loop where the person you're talking to hears themself since the mic is futher away from the speaker.  The only complaint would be I wish the volume went up just a bit more, it can be hard to hear people sometimes while driving on the freeway if they talk too quietly.  One note to anyone buying one...  the hole to plug the charger into is under the thing that holds it onto your ear, it rotates out of the way.  It took me awhile to find it when I first got it"
Logitech Mobile Freedom Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"To me the main problems with all headsets come on the receiving end and are either:a. Feedback loop:  Where the other person hears themself speakb. Ambient noise:  The other end hears everything around you, especially in a carIn minimizing these, the Mobile Freedom Bluetooth is the best.  I've tested my other 3 headsets with people on the same call and this one ranks the highest in voice clarity without extraneous noises.As for me, I hear everyone fine on all the headsets, but a conversation is a two-way street and if you've ever used a headset, I'm sure you're tired of hearing, ""Take me off that stupid thing!""The negatives with this headset are far outweighed by the call clarity.  Yes, it's big and ugly, but your friends will thank you.The other negative to be aware of (although I assume this is more due to the age of my headset as it's only recently started doing this) is that I've found is that after 1 year, while the battery still holds a charge well, it sometimes drops the link to the phone when I hang up after a call and I can't get it back until I recharge the thing.  Like I said, it's getting a bit old though.Overall, if I was going to buy a new one, I'd get this one.As far as the other 3 tested, I'll rank them in order of call quality (best to worst).Plantronics Discovery 655 (not too bad, but hard to keep in your ear)Jensen Stereo Headphones WBB100RX (more for wireless stereo headphones than for calling)Motorola HS850 (Looks cool, but a total piece of garbage)p.s.  If you're wondering why I have 4 headsets it's because there's nothing worse than losing the use of one of your hands while talking on the phone.  1 for the car, 1 for the home, 1 for the... well you get the picture."
BlackBerry 8100c Pearl (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I've had several gens of the candybar blackberries, 7100 nice but reception/mike was horrendous, 7130 much better, finally nailed it. Was dubious when I had to take a pearl when my 7130 went funky.... but I'll give it the full thumbs up now. Slightly smaller than 7130, which oddly does make a difference, like size decreases give exponential feasibility increases or something. Makes my partner's Treo look like a firstgen cell in comparison. Unobtrustive in yr pocket. The ""pearl"" trackball is just fine, like it better than roller actually. Reception, mike quality are also good, despite concerns that they were reviewed worse than the 7130. Writing is good too, the suretype continuing to be so durn accurate I sometimes forget to check. And hey, I like having the camera. So, I thought the 7130 was my perfect smartphone, the one that I just stopped thinking about cause it did it all just great.... but actually... I like the Pearl better. If you need bulletproof email, PDA, and phone, this is yr baby. Slightly shorter battery life, but hasn't stranded me yet."
BlackBerry 8100c Pearl (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"My first blackberry and I love it! I wanted to stop lugging around a phone AND a rather heavy Dell Axim just to have contacts, calendar and task-to-do list. I wanted a phone that synched with Outlook and was a great phone.  The Pearl is definitely the BEST choice.  I didn't really care about internet, music or camera, but the cheapest $30 internet plan from Cingular lets me have unlmited internet and access to home email instantly - it's just great!  I bought the $40 1Gb card and now have about 150 mp3 songs and pictures on it.  I use the mp3 songs as ringtones and it's GREAT to be able to instantly recognize who's calling from the music.  Camera is ok - not great, but ok and very nice to have for on-the-spot photos that you don't want to lug around the regular digital for.  I actually emailed a picture on the spot - very cool.  Battery life is phenomenal so far.  However, I'm not a heavy user and I used the profiles to have phone automatically shut off from 2am to 6am every day. Only cons so far are: 1) getting used to the keypad - believe what every one says about the intuitiveness of the keypad figuring out the correct word.  I've followed other folks' advice and don't really look at the words letter by letter - i type a sentence and then look - it works like a charm 9 times out of 10 that the keyboard correctly identifies each word.  Still, this type of entry is so different for a first time blackberry user, but getting used to this is still better than using a stylus and touch screen like the Axim.2) Also having trouble with having to restart if I change a ringtone for someone - I have to reseat the battery to get the change to take effect.  Hmmm...3) Volume when talking, even on speakerphone, is average - not terrible, but ok.  So far, my reception is fine.4) I also wonder how long the track ball will last - I'm not a heavy user and I still use it constantly.  I think i'm going to buy the insurance plan just in case.These minor cons are far outweighed by a simply GREAT phone that synchs with Outlook and so very much more.  Bye Bye Dell Axim.  It's true what some say - I'm a ""crackberry"" because playing with this thing is addictive. I'll update this review again in 3 months or so, but I don't anticipate any problems.  My only regret is I didn't hold out until a red Pearl came in stock at my local Cingular kiosk.  I would honestly give this phone 4.5 out 5 stars if they let you"
BlackBerry 8100c Pearl (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Top line: This is the best BlackBerry I've ever used, and among the best phones I've ever used.  I can use it at work and after hours with out compromise in functionality and style/size.I've been (some what grudgingly) using Blackberry since the first ""pager-style"" 4 line text device and the 8100 is a breakthrough for me.  Finally, I have a corporate device that treats me like a consumer!The good:- Great voice dial: particularly if you are a commuter with a headset.  No need to record your voice for each address entry- just say who you want to call and it it doesn't understand you it will prompt you for more info.- Size and appearance: Finally I don't look like a dork talking to something the size of my palm.  The phone is as small as many phone-only candy bars.- Easy private email set-up (as with all modern BlackBerries).  Seems to have some sort of auto set-up for Mac mail and Gmail, others too I imagine- Macintosh compatibility: I just bought ""The Missing Sync"" for Apple Mac OS X ($40 USD) to synchronize my address book, calendar, tasks and notes from my MacBook Pro.  Works great! The software provided by RIM is not very easy to use.- Fantastic screen and innovative ""Outlook Today"" style summery screen for missed calls, latest emails etc.  Look for this feature in one of the alternate themes that ships with the phone.- As others have mentioned, the keyboard is very good.  Coming from a full size BB keyboard, I thought I might miss it, but the 8100's is a breeze to use.The not as good:- Speaker phone is functional and sound quality in general is fine.  Nothing like my Sony Ericsson though...- I think I have a minor voice quality issue between the phone and my Motorola H700 headset (the best headset I've ever owned).  I think that it might be a compatibility issue. - More Mac compatibility would be appreciated - like native iSync and bluetooth support"
BlackBerry 8100c Pearl (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"This is my first BlackBerry device. In fact, this is the first cell phone I've had where I had a data plan setup. I gotta say I'm luving it! My email gets to me sometimes even before it shows up on my desktop. The browser is very robust and seems to work great. I've installed a few extra applications (google maps, bbweather, and Yahoo go to name a few) and I haven't had any problems. The applications cover a broad spectrum of interests and are really useful. I still have yet to try the Opera browser for the BB. The camera is so clear with and without the flash it's scary. It beats my old cameraphone hands down!I've discovered that the moniker ""CrackBerry"" is so true. I'm just hooked on getting emails, surfing the web and listening to some tunes, all from the same device at the same time. I've discovered a whole community of simmilar BB addicts and they are really helpful in discovering the ins of this device.The pearl's suretype keyboard learns as I go and words it didn't get right at first it now picks up and selects as I type. I don't even need to censor the typing too often anymore. I stuck with the suretype mode and caught on to it right quick. This may be because I've never used any other type of mobile device keyboard prior to the pearl. The learning curve was but a shallow hill. My only complaints are that the mp3 player will not play through a wireless headset. You can trick it into doing so, but normal play is only through the speaker on the device or through the wired headset. Also the speakerphone is a bit muffled as the battery cover actually covers up the speaker! Now there are after mod kits that have an oem battery cover with a hole for the speakerphone, but come on. Finally the vibration of the phone is kind of weak. Not a big complaint but it bears mentioning.Overall this device is great for beginners like myself. I cannot recommend it enough"
BlackBerry 8100c Pearl (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I just recently bought the Blackberry Pearl and I love the device. Its stylish, beautiful, small, and it has some awsome features. However, since i bought it from Amazon, Cingular took forever just to approve me and give me a new number. So I constantly had to call amazon and ask them about my order. Then I receive the phone almost a week later than the day I placed my order and as I follow the instructions my phone didn't want to work. So the representatives told me there was something wrong with my SIM card... when it wasn't. Luckily I called Cingular and a very HELPFUL representative helped me set up my account and ACTUALLY the service when Amazon told me there was something wrong with my SIM card LOL. Overall, Amazon should be more careful how they describe their phone activation process because it wasn't easy. But whatever I love shopping @ Amazon and I truly love my phone and I bet you will love it too. :)!!"
BlackBerry 8100c Pearl (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I've had this phone for about a week now and I'm glad I waited to post a review because my initial reaction was not very positive. Coming from owning a RAZR and many Windows-based devices, there was an initial learning curve to some of the functions. Also, I was NOT convinced that the strange keyboard would really recognize what you were attempting to type. Boy was I wrong about that one. OK, so for the review.My motivation for purchasing was primarily to get a PHONE first, with a few bells and whistles for when I just want to play with the device. The Pearl fits that bill perfectly. Phone quality is excellent. Loading ringtones (a pain at first) proved to be relatively easy once I did a little research. Ringtones play very loud and clear. The music player is MUCH better than first impressions would lead you to believe. After a few hours of frustration, I was all ready to purchase a 3rd party app. Again, did some research, visited a few forums, and found out there is much more functionality in the included music player than you might realize. As an owner of a NANO, I was disappointed with the interface of the player. But once you go into the menu functions, you'll find much more functionality. It's not an ipod, but it works as an decent replacement. And if you're not an ipod owner, you'll likely have no complaints. Sound of tunes is quite nice when using headphones. Camera is only so-so, but I don't really care about that anyway. Must admit that I thought it would be better since it is a megapixal camera. The couple of pictures I took were dark and somewhat grainy. Part of why I dropped my rating from 5 stars. As far as email, I have a BB from work and they won't let me use a non-work issued device to access the network, so I have no opinion on email functionality. Organizer features (calendar, tasks, notes, etc) seem more than adequate. Much better than any of my old Pocket PC devices.The only complaints I would have is that there are still 2 basic things that I haven't been able to figure out and while I'm admittingly not a techie, these should be pretty basic and intuitive. One, I would like to set one of my ringtones as the default ringer. That should be fairly simplistic but I can't figure it out. Two, I would like to change the order of the icons on some of the themes. Again, should be pretty basic, but no go. Almost forgot, can't listen to music through bluetooth. Not sure why, but this is really my only MAJOR complaint.Only minor complaints. All in all, a pretty sweet device. And BTW, form factor and looks are simply the best out there. I came so close to purchasing the Blackjack, very happy that I went with the Pearl.UPDATE - Figured out how to set default ringtone and move icons. Coming from a Windows mobile environment, I was expecting something along the lines of: Start-programs-etc-etc. Everyting in windows takes so many keystroks. With the Pearl, it was so easy. I was simply expecting it to be much more difficult based on my prior experience. I'm going to still keep it at 4 stars because of the lack of BT stereo. Otherwise, as close to a perfect device as I've used (and I've used quite a few)"

BlackBerry 8100c Pearl (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I had a palm 650 for two years. It had a few issues, but generaly speaking it worked well. Unfortunately one of my big concerns was the phone size.  When I first Bought it, I did not think it woud be a big deal. But after having it for a while, it felt like I was carring a brick in my packet (If you are an smart phone user, then you know what I am talking about.) I wanted to switch phones but all smart phones in the market had the same disadvantage of being good but huge on size. I was debating between a Q and a Bjack when I discovered the pearl. At first I thought it would not have the same capabilities of a palm, Q, or bjack; but I had it for 3 months now and to tell the truth,there is so many advantages on this phone I do not miss my palm at all. The pearl not only does not have the flaws that palm does, but also has the same (or more) capabilities and browsing speed. The trackball works way better than a touchscreen. So far I am very happy with my purchase that I am glad I got the pearl and not the Q or Bjack. The best part is that I finally feel that I am carring a phone and not a brick in my packet. Not sure about it? then do not believe me; simply check the reviews of all smarth phones online. You will be surprised to find that the pearl gets usually Higher grades than most other smart phones"

But the ""thickness"" gains you considerable protection.  I have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch.  I like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type.  The function buttons are under the skin, but easy to press.  "

Silicon Skin Protective for Palm Treo 700w 700p (700W / 700P Clear): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product."
Silicon Skin Protective for Palm Treo 700w 700p (700W / 700P Clear): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow"
Audiovox 8610 Vox Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,This is a great phone for a first phone for kids. I have had it for six months and it is the best one I have ever had. I like it so much that I don't wanna get rid of it
Audiovox 8610 Vox Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"This phone is great! I got it for Christmas and it works like a charm! The loud speaker is excellent and the ringtones are cool. Some of the wallpapers are a bit weird but they have nice ones too. The ringtones are loud and you can easily hear it ringing. the LCD screen is big and the menus are easy to navigate. The buttons are a comfortable size and I love this phone. So far I haven't found any flaws at all and the phone has great battery life. I had to  keep it on for a few hours and the bars stayed the same! I highly reccomend this phone to any who like it. The phone is light weight and small and it doesn't get in the way! I love this phone and have encouraged someone to get one already. Even though it doesn't have a camera, I'd say that it is still great! As for the cons....I cannot think of any and anyone who says that you cannot hear it ring or Virgin Mobile is no good has the wrong company. Virgin Mobile is great but not designed for those people who are on their phones all day. It's not the phone's fault."
Audiovox 8610 Vox Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I bought this little phone 8 months ago and am truly pleased with it.  I don't use it every day, or even every week.  I got it to keep with me when I'm driving and for those inevitable times when something goes wrong and you need a phone right now.  It has paid me more in peace of mind than it could ever cost in dollars.  What I like about the phone itself is that it is very small and light and can be easily tucked inside pockets or small bags.  It charges fully in a very short time, under two hours the first time out of the box and in under an hour after that.  It holds that charge for a very long time as I just found out recently. Driving to an appointment I was running late and needed to call to let them know.  I'd forgotten to recharge the phone for over 2 months and expected it to be dead as a doornail.  To my delight it turned right on and I made the call with no problems.  Can't beat that.  The Virgin prepay plan is perfect for users like me and ends up costing about $6 a month.  Tell me there's something better and I'll say prove it.  I looked long and hard to find the best possibility and this was it.  I think it still is.  For a nice, dependable ""insurance"" type phone, I couldn't be more pleased and genuinely recommend it."
Audiovox 8610 Vox Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This phone is great!  It has all the basic features I wanted out of a phone and I was able to fix the  low ringtone problem by searching for ""audiovox 8610 hack"" over the internet.You can purchase a cable on ebay and d/l some free softwares over the net. Then you can make all the ringtones you ever wanted for free.  Of course you have to be computer-savey to do so.  So don't do it unless you know what you're doing.The phone allows 20 seconds of mp3 and midi playback for each ringtone.  The cool thing is that each ringtone can be attached to a phone number in the phonebook so you know who's calling by the ring.I downloaded a bunch of sound effects wav files from the net and mix 'n match them into an mp3 file for some great ringtones.  example:  3 stooges sound +  bell ring + whistle +  homer ""doh"" + wolf howl - all in one 20 second ringtone.I also made some ringtones out of my favorite rock songs as well.  I noticed some songs and sound-effects are louder than others.  Thus I only keep the loudest  ringtone and they're very loud!  I only set the sound volume to 3 and I can hear the ring in my pocket and backpack.Overall, this phone is always on sale at places like Target. If you can make your own ringtone and download it into the phone, you can have all the free custom ringtones you could ever dream of"
Audiovox 8610 Vox Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I have to admit, if you want more from prepaid, Virgin Mobile is a rip off. But if you're only going to use your phone once in a while, then it's alright. I bought my Audiovox about a year or two ago and it was a good investment. Sleek phone, outer dsiplay, the calls were good quality and I never would get dropped calls. Furthermore, the color display is great and the battery life is amazing. The phone has all the basic features, looks great, and is practical for anyone who's not looking for anything outrageous like cameras or Mp3. I have also say that despite the service Vmobile has good phones.But now that I'm needing my phone more and more I'm ready to dump Virgin Mobile because the whole 25 cents a minute and 10 cents after that is too expensive. I have to agree with the other reviews. And for their new ""promotions"" those hardly last and are only for new customers..so much for customer service. The ringtones are a little pricey, but still reasonable; test messaging is available at 10 cents, good price. If you want to get more features, minutes, whatever, I say look into other prepaid offers like net10, tracphone or T-mobile. You get more prepaid with t-mobile but the phones with good stuff will cost you a bit more"
Kyocera switch_back Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"hey...im also 14 yrs old and i've owned this phone for about 2 months....i absolutely luv this fone...i originally wanted the tmobile sidekick. but i couldn't switch my carrier and it was waayyy expensive...so i looked for a fone that is great for texting and i wouldnt have to pay alot for texting...and i found this one !!!!...the only thing is it doesn't have an mp3 player nor a camcorder...also, it is a bit bulky and it doesn't have as much features as the enV...but i have it for what i wanted it for....TEXTING...this fone has instant messaging and multimedia messaging..virgin mobiles service is good, but i have to be honest i do not use this fone to talk, but only to text...so i can't tell u how the talking service is...my parents totally luv virgin mobile for teens...u don't have to be a teenager to have this fone, but this fone is ideal for a ""text-crazed teenager""..BUY THIS FONE !!!*** i jus found out that kyocera has a new upcoming fone...its lyke the 2nd version to the switchback...its called the kyocera m1000...so look it up and see wat its about...it looks just lyke the ""enV"
Kyocera switch_back Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I bought my cell through an auction site about 2 months ago, so I got a good deal on it. Well, as some have mentioned the phone has shutdown on me only once while I was using the QWERTY keyboard. Other than that I have had no problems, call reception is great. The camera on this phone isn't the greatest but I don't need it to be high end for the basic fun pics I take. If you're looking to get zoom in, larger, clearer pictures this isn't the phone for you. The camera screens can be a bit confusing but I've learned to deal with it & my pics come out as I like. A strange feature is the speakerphone, while it is quite loud & clear, Kyocera placed it on the inner flip side of the phone which muffles the sound. Aside from these things, I love my switchback. The QWERTY keyboard is perfect for txting but may be too cumbersome for larger fingers as the keys are small. As far as plans are concerned I don't have any problems w/ over charges since I have the 18 cents/min plan. It's good to know that the monthly plans aren't recommended though. A bonus to the per minute plans is the Sugar Mama service, where you get free airtime for giving your opinion on minute video clips. Good for purchasing games or ringtones w/o using up your top-up money.And this cell isn't only for the young crowd, I'm an over 25 mom. I got this phone b/c other carriers hardly carry QWERTY phones & those that do require addt'l internet service plans (like Blackberry's, Black Jack & Palm TREO's). I only wanted to easily send txts & have it in one compact phone. This was ideal for me"
Kyocera switch_back Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"Ok. I can say I have been a realtor, a nurse,an HR person, a mom. That means a heavy phone user- since 1990. My first phone was the old motorola brick analog. One of the greatest and biggest phones ever. I remember my first digital phone, and first pnone with games. I have had a total of 5 phones, motorola, nokia, ericson, panasonic. This kyocera is the best. I don't want a treo palm because I already travel with a lap top. What I want is a text phone that is small and easy to use. This querty key board rocks. The menu is just like a computer and easy to make selections. The more features you need on the phone, the more you want a qwerty key board. Get this phone and be happy. Also the saleslady threw it on the ground and when the back came off she snapped it back on and used it. Very sturdy little phone, and the antena is the loop so it won't poke you. Comes with  a very easy to read guide book so start up is easy. I paid $199 for this phone in my region and it is worth every penny"

The cord is about 3 feet long and it plugs in horizontally, which is nice in that it does not block the second outlet.  It's fairly light weight and made of plastic, but seems durable enough.  A small red LED lights up when the charger is pluged into an outlet, regardless of whether you're charging your phone or not.  I debated giving this four or five stars and decided to give it five based on the great price"
Samsung Blackjack Smartphone (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I purchase this phone for both my wife and I, and we both love them. Windows Mobile 5 takes a little time to learn to navigate, but is very versatile and functional. Reception and call quality are great, and pairing with a bluetooth headset was quick and painless. The screen is bright and crisp. There is no 3g in my area, but Edge works good and the speed is bearable for simple web browsing. Media player works well. Battery life is good with 3g turned off. This phone comes with both a standard and extended battery. With pretty heavy usage, I still have 1/2 battery power at night. 3g is said to really suck the power, though. Lots and lots of 3rd party software available to make this phone do pretty much whatever you want"
Samsung Blackjack Smartphone (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I've been using my Blackjack for about 3 months now and I love it. Sure there are things I would change, but the Blackjack has come very close to fulfilling all my wishes. Cons: * The keyboard buttons are really small, but then I'm not sure how you could fit all of them on the phone if they were bigger. And I wouldn't want the phone to get any bigger. * If you ever see an ad that has a number like this - ""1-800-Big-Deal"" good luck on figuring out the alpha-to-numeric translation. Haha. I had that issue not long ago. However, I think all smartphones have that issue.* Lacks voice dialing via bluetooth headset. This one is big for me. I upgraded to the BJ from a Razr and really miss this feature.Pros:The list would be too long if I mentioned all the great features about this phone. So here are a few:* Browser support is awesome! I can view everything, even Flash apps!* VPN support. If you are corporate, 'nuff said. This rocks.* Easy bluetooth setup and management.* Perfect size for a Smartphone. Not too wide and very thin.* Glass screen (doesn't scratch) and screen resolution is unbelievable.* Quick toggle scroll button on side is a life saver.* Extended life battery comes with the phone. * Easy side access to SD card. No having to slide the battery off to remove or replace.There are a ton of great things about this phone. I hear the iPhone is supposed to be the real deal, but until I see for myself, I'm sticking with this beauty. Buy one. You won't be sorry. I got mine for $75 with a $75 rebate. Free? Can't go wrong which ever way you look at it. :)"
Samsung Blackjack Smartphone (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"This phone is a great corporate phone.  It is the best windows mobile phone currently available, in my oppinion. They overlooked a few features:  -There is no LCD light to tell you its charging status - instead the screen has to be on all the time.  -There is no way to know when the num lock key is on - so you just have to press a number key and see what comes up.-In order to unlock the phone, you have to press the on/off button at the top of the phone, which is not in a very convenient location.-The track wheel feels pretty cheep"
Samsung Blackjack Smartphone (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"this has a nice wide color screen with amazing clarity and picture quality.  Syncs to Windows PC and MS Office with ease.  Great feature is the off phone battery recharging and the included second battery.  Having one battery to recharge and using the other until the phone dies should keep the life of the battery longer.  Not having to worry about plugging in to recharge is totally awesome.  Nice to see this feature return.  When cellphone first came out this was a standard feature, then it was optional, then it was gone.  Get the extra long life battery if you plan to use this as a video or MP3 music player.  Video conversion is a bit spotty and frustrating.  Many videos will convert and then not display.  Music is no problem.  Any MP3 or MS Windows media player audio format will play.  Convert is easy with Windows Media Player 10 or 11.  Sorry Win2k users (forget NT or Win9X or Me), video conversion is not available on any MS OS older than XP and Windows Media Player 10 and 11 are only on XP.  Get a MicroSD card and put your music on that card and you can play it from there.  Pictures can also be stored on the SD card or in the 64Megs of internal memory.  Since this is a MS Smartphone, there are lots of 3rd party software and games for this phone.  Be aware of the aspect ratio, this is a landscape display and not portrait.  If you get games or applications for it be  sure of the aspect ratio.  This is a 240H by 320W display.  Size your pictures to the display and you will be happy with the clarity and sharpness. The thumbwheel is great for navigation and web browsing.Niggles:1. Camera is slow and not very clear, but none of the camera phones I have seen are very good either.2. need more ring tones. The ones that come with this phone are lame at best.  Download or create some of your own.3. Need more menu choices.  The ones that come with it are OK but take some navigation to get around.4. Hate the Cingular activation policy and cost for the internet access service (but that is not the phone's fault so maybe I should not list this complaint)"

RIM BlackBerry 8100 8100c Pearl Leather Pocket Case HDW-12725-004 - Bulk Packing: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I used the Seidio rubberized case before this. It is thinner and the Pearl is barely noticed in a pocket. This case is about 1/2 inch wider and thicker, but it protects the phone on all sides except the top. The phone slips in and out effortlessly. It looks great, and the magnet puts it to sleep, which is nice. Even though it is a bit more bulky I can't go back to the Seidio because of the protection and looks. I just use a screen protector, but many use Best Skins Ever with it no problem. It's also pretty cheap ($15). Less than the Seidio and other pouches out there."

Speck Products ToughSkin with Belt Clip for Sansa e200 (Black): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"This is a great cover to the Sansa MP3 player.  It is heavy duty rubber that is thin where it can be and thicker in all the necessary places.  It has a hard plastic screen shield that protects the Sansa screen from scratching or shattering.  You'd be silly not to purchase this $20 case to protect your $150+ investment.The one downside I can forsee is that the cover is too thick at the bottom to allow the player to sit in most cradles, docks, or speakers.  It is not difficult to put the case on, but it would be frustrating to take it on and off often.  Just something to consider if you see yourself using the player in docks or speakers often.  The standard USB cable that come with the product works great with the toughskin on"
Speck Products ToughSkin with Belt Clip for Sansa e200 (Black): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I gave this four stars because the `jacket' adds significant bulk and weight to the Sansa product. What was once a slim, sleek product is now a rather large, rubberized item. On the plus side, this jacket definitely protects the MP3; it is very solid, and covers the item completely and securely. They included a belt clip, and a screen cover that is very hard and will not be easily scratched. The buttons around the wheel are far easier to press now. I wish there were other color choices, but over all I'm very pleased with the product. Before it was covered I was reluctant to put in my purse or pocket for fear of breakage and scratches to the screen, but now I feel very safe carrying the Sansa and taking it anywhere I go. Highly recommended product"
Speck Products ToughSkin with Belt Clip for Sansa e200 (Black): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"The Sansa e200 is good for all of the things it will do considering it is only a flash memory based player similar to the Ipod Nano.  Unlike, the Nano it will play video and comes with its own video conversion software.  Further, unlike the Nano, the Sansa has a built in FM tuner and FM recorder which can be nice.  Finally, the sansa has a voice recorder which I do not have a personal use for but just goes to show how feature rich this mp3 player is.On the negative side:The Sansa, which will accept upto a 2gig MicroSD memory card, but turns on slowly when a memory card is placed in the expansion slot.I like to listen to audio books and the Sansa does not have the ability to bookmark.  This makes listening to audio books very difficult.Overall, the Sansa is a very feature rich player with a great battery life   with only a few shortcomings"

It is very well made, and seems like it will do an excellent job of protecting the Sansa even from a fall.  The funny thing is that now that it is in the ToughSkin I am much less likely to drop it.  Before I bought the ToughSkin, the my e280 was very slippery and easily dropped.  Now that it is in the case, it is very easy to hold and grip with very little pressure.  It is true that the buttons are easier to push with the ToughSkin on than it was without it.  The hard plastic screen cover was a surprising positive about this case as well.  The only problem being that the screen cover seems to scratch more easily than I would expect.  Overall, this is an excellent product that I would not hesitate to recommend"
Speck Products ToughSkin with Belt Clip for Sansa e200 (Black): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This cover is the best you can get for your Sansa E series player. It increases the size a little but the durability is worth it. The belt clip is great cause I use mine at the gym too. I purchased an armband but this is much better.  It also comes with a display cover that I have discovered is a necessary item, my display began to show minor scratches after only a couple of weeks use, so if you don't buy this, at least get the little expensive stick on covers. The toughskin also makes the function buttons work a little easier. The small down side to this cover is not being able to get to the micro-sd slot without removing the Sansa, but that is only a small issue. My advice, you have spent big bucks for a great little mp3 player so spend a little more and protect it the best you can"

Sydney Harbour Motorola v180 / v186 / v188 Lambskin Leather Case / Holster - NOT GENERIC: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,I got this case/holster a while back after another maker's fell apart in a short time.  I was impressed with the reviews I saw here. What I would add is that the case is durable and I am very pleased with it after owning it for about 6 months
Sydney Harbour Motorola v180 / v186 / v188 Lambskin Leather Case / Holster - NOT GENERIC: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This case was a perfect fit for my Mot V180 phone. The top and bottom pieces slip on the phone separately, then snap together so they stay in place on the phone so it can't easily fall out (a problem that I'd had with a different product). The part that slips over the top of the phone has a built-in see-through window that lines up just right, so that the external display can be seen while the phone is in the case.The quality of construction looks to be pretty good, too"
Sydney Harbour Motorola v180 / v186 / v188 Lambskin Leather Case / Holster - NOT GENERIC: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I was a little skeptical about buying this case for my phone. I wanted a holster that wasn't a sloppy generic model that didn't fit. I was absolutely pleased when this one arrived and I tried it on my Motorola V180. It fits like a glove and looks good. No complaints here. So if you have a V180 and your on the fence about taking the plunge and buying this let me assure you, that you won't be disappointed. The added bonus is the money you will save over buying one from your cell phone dealer:"
Sydney Harbour Motorola v180 / v186 / v188 Lambskin Leather Case / Holster - NOT GENERIC: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This is a great case! I have a Motorola V180 and have purchased and returned 2 phone cases prior to this purchase having only had the phone for a month because they were such poor quality or the holes didn't line up.  Because this is a flip phone, most cases move when you open and shut the phone, covering speakers, etc.  This case is 2 pieces that connect together so the movement, when you open and close the phone, doesn't affect the placement of the holes, etc. in the case.  Also, the quality of materials and fit of this case are excellent. "
Sydney Harbour Motorola v180 / v186 / v188 Lambskin Leather Case / Holster - NOT GENERIC: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"After reading the reviews here of this case, I thought I'd take the plunge and try it.

Sydney Harbour Motorola v180 / v186 / v188 Lambskin Leather Case / Holster - NOT GENERIC: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,From longviewer's advice I got this case and he was right on!!!! Awesome custom fit!! Great case for the money THANK YOU !!!  Gar
Sydney Harbour Motorola v180 / v186 / v188 Lambskin Leather Case / Holster - NOT GENERIC: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"This is for all the folks who got the free or nearly free Motorola V180 - Spend the money on this case to protect your phone!  I looked at many different cases in stores and online hoping to find something handsome but even more importantly - really PROTECTIVE.  The V180 apparently has had a few comments on the home screen going ka-plooky - 'nuf said - I needed a better grade, clear interior protector for the screen and touchpad.  Sydney Harbour gets high marks on this feature - not flimsy dull plastic but very clear, quality stuff.  Secondly, the super-soft, matte black leather is a sweet fit - nice and snug, form-fitting with no feel of strain or awkward stretching.  The cut outs are perfectly lined up too - there IS one for the speaker phone feature on the back (not mentioned in the ads).  Snap on the antenna loop and it gives the whole thing a very nice custom look and feel.  Sure this might look like a lot of review for a simple product - but if you're like me and only allow a few little bits of finery in your life, you try to make smart and carefully considered purchases. Be nice to yourself and your phone - Go with Sydney Harbour and avoid the cheaper stuff"

I also use it on a wall outlet and the car.  No problems.  The cords retract when you want to fold it up so very convenient.  It does not come with a case, so you'll use your own bag or whatever.  The part that fits into the Treo is very secure.  It does not pop off like other chargers.  The only thing I can see that could be a problem is if you are rough with the pieces or they are just loose in a bag they can get lost or possibloy damaged"

Blackberry Lambskin Leather Swivel Holster for 8100 Pearl: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"These cases were not available when the Pearl hit the market, we were able to get them from this merchant.  Good quality item at a great price.  Thank you"
Blackberry Lambskin Leather Swivel Holster for 8100 Pearl: Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I love my Blackberry Pearl and my swivel case is the icing on the proverbial cake.  Good quality swivel mechanism that appears to have the potential to last a long time, something that prior holsters have failed to do. I also like the magnetic closure, which snaps closed securely and quickly once I place my Pearl into the case, without the need for finding a snap fitting.  My older Blackberries have had cases which, after use, had their entries obstructed by flaps that fold over causing me to use the ""two-handed"" method for nesting my phone, one hand to move the flap out of the way, and the other to insert the phone into the case.  This is a very frustrating occurence since I am usually attempting the more-preferred ""one-handed"" approach. Although still relatively new, my new case appears to have no such appendage which might at a later date become worn and tired thereby causing an obstruction. Before I purchased my Leather Swivel case, I looked at 3rd party generic cases.  Each of these were unable to ""notify"" my Blackberry that it was in its holster.  With my new swivel case, as soon as I insert my Pearl, the display shuts off thereby extending battery life.  In addition, this feature allows different profiles to be selected for when my BB is holstered or not.  Also, since this is an OEM case, it was made especially for my Pearl.  When holsetered, both the USB connector,the earphone outlets and the volume control buttons are all accessible. With non-OEM cases, in order to use a hands free device or to charge my phone, I might have to remove the phone from its case. I am a little disappointed that the Pearl came with no case at all.  This is probably due to its small size and your ability to just slip the phone into your shirt pocket, unlike prior Blackberry devices.  Of course, that still exposes the vulnerable display to significant scratch-potential.  They should have at least provided a simple pouch, which would provide some protection.  This of course is a comment on the Pearl itself and not the swivel case, which is the subject of THIS review.  All-in-all, I highly recommend this case for those of you who still wear your phones on your belt ... and since I'm at it, I LOVE MY PEARL"

palm Treo 680 Smartphone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,I have tried 4-5 of theses phones over the last 4 years.  This one works the best of all I have tried.  The latest was the Cingular 8525 (HTC makes it) and it dropped 80% of incoming calls on pickup and 20% of outgoing calls. I thinks Windows was loading a DLL - (;<))) The Palm OS is much quicker to respond to input than the Windows based SPs
palm Treo 680 Smartphone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I've had a Treo 650 for a long time.  I wasn't 100% sure I'd want the 680, when it was first announced, but a big nasty scratch on my 650's screen helped me decide to take the plunge.  I'm so glad I did.  The lack of a protruding antenna makes it fit in my pocket much better, the internal slot for the SIM card eliminates my worry that it might get lost, and the covered SD card slot is very welcome, because the darned thing always popped out in my 650.  The only thing lost from the 650 is the reset button.  To reset the 680, you have to take out the battery.  That's not a big deal, since even on the 650, you have to remove the battery cover to get to the reset switch.  What's better on the 650?  The main thing for me is that the cell phone's radio is slightly more sensitive and that it will take 8gb SD cards (SDHC).  I use this phone for everything, since it's also a great Palm organizer.  In addition to that, I've installed a registered version of Pocket Tunes, so it's a very good MP3 player.  It's even compatible with PlaysForSure, if you're into that.  That's why I'm so happy to see the 8gb support.  I also use the phone to play games, like Monopoly and Scrabble, when I'm waiting on line or in a boring meeting.  I have absolutely zero complaints about this phone."
palm Treo 680 Smartphone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"Believe it or not, i consider going from a BlackJack to a Treo 680 an upgrade. i guess the whole battery problem depends on the usage and the person. My battery problem is that i cant kill the darn thing! I am one of those people that depletes a battery completely before recharging it. I do it to my laptop and my iPod and the PDA i had before the BlackJack, the Tungsten 2E. Devoted Palm users will absolutely dispise the Windows Mobile 5 available on BlackJacks. Mainly because you CAN NOT create and edit word, excel or pdf files and the biggest problem for me was its complete depndence on Outlook. Which i absolutley can not put up with. Even the contacts wouldn't backup! Needless to say, the Treo 680 saved me. If you do go the way of the blackjack without Outlook, look into SBSH's programs Facade and Papyrus. However, if you go with the lovely Treo check out ""DialByPhoto"" i think the coolest part is how you can set up a ""Favorite 5"" like TMobile offers but still have all the reliability of Cingular"

Especially since it has a beautiful 2.2 in touchscreen.  The display is incredible.  I can go on microsoft word and do what i need to do.  The last thing is that the price for everything it does is outstanding you should get it when it is cheap if you have the chance"

I've wanted a TREO for a few years but could never justify spending big bucks for one. You can work around the problems with the unit with new battery and browser software, it's a nice little phone.I haven't bought a memory card for it, so I can't report on the mp3 capabilities, but I am going in that direction.

palm Treo 680 Smartphone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I bought this even though I saw a lot of negative reviews, some about battery life, some about dropped signals. So far I have had neither.I have owned many Palm devices over the years and I will be the first one to say that Palm can make lemons, and when that happens they usually deny it until they come up with a patch much later, if they ever do. Not the most customer-oriented, quality-oriented company out there. But their OS is still the easiest to use in my mind, and with the myriad of apps out there you can make it do whatever you want, pretty much. The screen is on the smallish side compared to the TX, but it's not that bad, especially for a phone. It's pretty reliable, and I have put a lot of my old software on it. The battery is what surprised me the most; I was expecting something really bad, but so far I have never been under 50%, and I am a heavy Palm user. I don't use the phone part of it much, just a call here and there, and I turn the phone function off at night. I also bought KBLightsOff, which turns off the keyboard lights unless you are using it, which probably helps a lot. So with these two settings, battery life is close to the TX in my opinion.I have one dead pixel, but that can happen to any electronics manufacturer. I don't like the 2.5mm jack at the bottom of the device, that's a terrible place to put it. But with an adapter I can use my good headphones and sound is good. Get pTunes Deluxe so you can use subsription music like Napster or Yahoo Music. I should receive my 8GB SDHC card tomorrow, which will turn my Treo into an iPhone killer, IMHO. And for way less than $599...Sound level is OK, and you can get software that boosts it up if you're deaf. Speaker level is LOUD! The SMS program is great, the phone app is great and fast.So, overall, it's a great device. I wish Palm wouldn't charge an arm and a leg for accessories, but you don't have to buy from them.."

palm Treo 750 Smartphone (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"Bought this to replace my three-year-old cell phone and an ancient but still working Palm IIIc.  My observations after 30 days of ownership:1.  Setup is time consuming but unavoidable.  Patience is required.  I've had a couple of questions that I asked Cingular, only to be forwarded to Palm, only to be forwarded to Microsoft, then back to Cingular.  It seems no Customer Service department has really mastered this unit.2.  Have to do a soft reset every once in a while.  The unit turns off the sound by itself and the only way I've found to fix it is to do a soft reset.3.  I'm not crazy about Microsoft Outlook's calendar compared to Palm's.  I miss several Palm features, like the ""Go to"" and the ""Today"" buttons.  Outlook's calendar just isn't as easy to manuever as Palm's.4.  Phone listening volume is low, especially when the unit is in a protective case, which puts it a little further from your ear.5.  Love the Bluetooth option.  It's new to me and it's just great.6.  Love being able to press a picture to make a call.  We have five kids; I have each kid's picture linked to their phone number.  Even my technology-challenged husband can call them by simply pressing their picture.  7.  This phone talks!  A female voice announces who is calling and when your next appointment is.  The first time she spoke it about scared me to death.  The voice reminds me of the computer on Star Trek--but not as clear.  However, after getting used to her accent, she is intelligible, which means the computer is translating my written input into spoken words--amazing!8.  The Internet connection has limited use for me.  I don't need email on the run and I could live without this and the extra monthly cost.  Most traditional Internet web sites take much too long to load and display too small a portion of the page to be useful.  It is nice to check the weather or get directions on the go.  9.  Can't imagine watching a movie or any complex video on this tiny screen.  What's the point?10.  Splurged on a sweet little Vaja leather case that is wonderful.  Very expensive, but a terrific luxury.11.  Amazon's prices were the best BY FAR on this product! Saved over $300 off my local retail Cingular dealer. 12.  Best part:  I no longer have to carry a PDA and a cell phone!  They are one and the same!  13.  Conclusion: this phone is very smart and fun to use, although it comes with a big learning curve.  The low volume issue could be a problem for someone with bad hearing"
palm Treo 750 Smartphone (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"The whole process took only 5 minites on the phone with Cingular Wireless Customer Service to port over my number from Verizon.  The Treo 750 was a snap to figure out, setting up my email took only a few minutes.  I've owned it for three weeks now and I am still discovering great phone/PDA features.

The phone is Microsoft OS based (I used a palm device before) so getting use to it took me a couple of days but not really a big issue.

As a result, I was forced to create a new speed dial icon with my voice mail number.I really hope this is a problem to be fixed soon by Palm with a downloadable file because, except for this problem, Treo 750 is really great"

Motorola i760 Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"my husband uses this phone for work and it has one of the funniest ringtones i've ever heard. i don't know what it's called but it has an upbeat techno rhythm to it. the walkie talkie feature is very useful as everyone in his business network uses it all the time, including him. it's great for a business that has many locations. i only give this product four stars because i haven't tried it myself so i don't know all the features. but i hope the review i've provided helps"
Motorola i760 Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"I came over from Cingular after trying there PTT, just not happening for me,  and I will leave it at that.I choose this phone because of the large display and the color of the phone overall, ( Love Blue ) I bought this for 110.00 at a corporate store, I get a discount for the company I work for. We had a problem with the second one took it back and swapped it for a brand new in the box phone.  The clarity and ease of functionality is Fantastic, you dont have to be a rocket scientist to operate this phone and the GPS along with Telenav is fantastic, we also selected this phone because if your not with in range of a cell tower I can still connect to one another like normal walkie talkie's,  hey if your going to spend the money do it right the first time.   I put the extended battery on mine and I get 2 to 3 days before having to recharge, which too me is great.  Dont change the default times for backlighting, thats whats eating the battery time up,  also dont leave a java application in suspension that will eat the battery up also.Buy the data cable and add your own ringtones and backgrounds, Moto has a phonebook manager package on there site which is FREE and is SO easy to use.   For Ringtones and wallpapers u can use WebJal, once again EASY to use.   I looked at other phones and I DONT NEED CAMERAS in a phone, the primary selling feature was the fact of large numbers and ease of use.Michae"
Motorola i760 Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,5.0,"My husband and I just recently upgraded to this phone.We were going to got to the i560 but got a great deal on these. So far so good. I switched from an i730. What a difference! It seems lighter. It fits in my pocket better. the other always came unclipped when I stood up, falling to the ground. I like the sound quality better also. The screen is a little bigger than the i730 also. The front screen for caller ID seems a little dark and the area to charge it is a little harder to get to(that plastic still gets in the way!) Those are the only negatives so far. I really like the buttons on the i760. Since my husband is switching from an old i90 he loves it! Hope this helps with purchasing. Also if you have no service you can use these as walkie talkies. We haven't tried that yet"
Motorola i760 Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,"I was having problems with my second i730 transmitting and receiving, so I decided to upgrade my phones.  (the first 730's speaker grill came off, and i tried to glue it back on myself.  A word to the wise, don't use too much glue.)  So, I went to Nextel to get my new i760 after researching it on the internet.  I didn't need a camera phone, since I have a digital camera that takes awesome pictures.  One bad thing is that since I changed my phone back in April, I couldn't sign back up for two years and get the $150.  I could only sign up for a year, and I had to pay $275.  I don't understand that.  But this review is about the phone:Cons: super short battery life, especially if you have the web.instead of having a separate button for each number key, it has three big keys, with little squares to make it look like there are separate keys. unfortunately, you have to be careful and hit the button fairly close to center, otherwise you'll dial the number above or beneath it.  the jury is still out on this one, but i'll list it under cons.  the casing looks like it might break easy since it is mainly plastic, whereas the 730 at least looked like some sort of metal.pros:huge displaya whole lot lighter than the 730i enjoy the photo caller id.  it also shows the photo when you call that personthe sleep mode is a good addition.  if you don't use the phone for a couple of minutes, the phone will power down a little like your screen saver so all you have to do is push a button to wake it up.The only thing I really miss from the 730 is the multitude of the lights around the motorola emblem on the front, especially since there were several colors.  This phone just blinks a lot to your ring tone in a light blue.  OH well.  I'll write more the more i explore the phone. "
"Palm Treo 650 JAVOSkin - The Soft Low-Profile Case, Steel Blue: Cell Phones & Service",4.0,"I really like the JAVOSkin for my Treo -- it's well made and has openings so all the features of the treo are usable.  The material is soft to the touch but strong on protection.  I don't like the lanyard they send with the product, it's about 24"" long and reminds me of shoelaces.  I prefer a smaller, more delicate lanyard that would go around my wrist"
"Palm Treo 650 JAVOSkin - The Soft Low-Profile Case, Steel Blue: Cell Phones & Service",5.0,"I tripped and basically THREW my Treo about 15 feet onto the sidewalk.  With the skin on it, no harm done.  None.  This is the second skin I've owned - the first from JAVOSkin - and I like this one better than the first.  The skin is thicker but the covered buttons are better defined and easier to use.  I didn't like the cord attaching bump on the side at first - but I did attach the cord and now it is easier for me to find in my handbag.  I highly recommend this product - whether or not you use the cord"

RIM Blackberry 8700c Leather Holster with Swivel Belt Clip Black (ACC-10540-003): Cell Phones & Service,4.0,This is perfect for someone who is prone to knock things around that are on their belt. My husband uses this one and it has taken lots of knocks. I would give it 5 starts but its downside is that it dulls the vibration so he misses alot of calls

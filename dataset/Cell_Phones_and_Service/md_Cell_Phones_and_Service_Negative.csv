Jabra C150 Headset for 2.5mm Universal Headset Jack: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,The darn thing broke almost immediately.When I tried to switch gel covers (it comes with 3 different sizes) the entire earpiece came off in my hands!What a flimsy piece of crap.I just sent it back to Amazon. I'm never buying a Jabra product again
Jabra C150 Headset for 2.5mm Universal Headset Jack: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I bought this for $30 from Best Buy. What a waste of money!The ear gels are comfortable at first, but after an hour or so, your ear starts to really hurt from it.The sound quality is TERRIBLE! People I am talking to sound very muddled and overly loud, even on the lowest volume setting on my Motorola v300.What is worse, people I am talking to hear me very poorly. They say there is so much background noise it sounds like I am in a noisy bar, even when I'm just sitting in my car. People can barely hear me over the background noise racket"
Jabra C150 Headset for 2.5mm Universal Headset Jack: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"Beware!  The ""Product Features"" for this product specifieda ""Call answer and end button on the headset."" The device I received did not have that feature.  I selected this model because of the advertised feature.  Amazon.com's description was erroneous and misleading.  I returned the item and was charged for the return shipping.  I emailed them notifying them that it was their fault for falsely advertising a feature that was not part of the product. They ignored my email.In the online return process, there's no option that states the return was a result of Amazon.com's fault.  Basically, they falsely advertise so that you buy the product, and when you discover it's not the right one you're screwed.  I now understand all those complaints I've read about Amazon.com.  I'll take the loss this time, but I won't repeat my mistake and order from them again.  Buyer beware!This review is not so much about the product as it is about Amazon.com's false description of the product. I couldn't use the product so sorry I couldn't give a review about it"
Jabra EarWave Boom with Universal 2.5mm connector: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I purchased this item for use while driving my car in Oct of 2005 for $29.00 without tax.  I was told it would work for the LG phones which is what I haveI see now you can no longer find these for sale and gee I wonder why...I probable used this item a total of 8 times when I drove my manual transmission car, I didnt really use it while driving my truck which was automatic.  The Jabra now does not work...and after only 8 uses, a friend of mine also bought one and his lasted about 6 months as well.  While using it the phone cuts out and the caller can not hear you at the other end and you have to constantly pull the plug and stick it back in, after a while you just give up cause it doesnt work.I emailed the company several times at info@jabra.com but have not tried to call them yet and had no results with the emails.  I have a feeling I lose anyways with this purchase.The thing is not worth the money and does not seem to last long and is not made for LG cell phones, Iknow the one I got with the phone stinks due to the fit but al least it was free and still works top notch.To bad this was a comfortable ear piece but very short lived. do not purchase this even for the 4.99 prices you may find it for on Ebay"
Jabra EarWave Boom with Universal 2.5mm connector: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,Junk. Junk. Junk.  Mine lasted for only three weeks then one day stopped working
Jabra EarWave Boom with Universal 2.5mm connector: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,I went through 2 of these in as many months - the sound quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working. People regularly had a hard time understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone couldn't even distinguish between 'yes' and 'no.'
Jabra EarWave Boom with Universal 2.5mm connector: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,Design is great and very comfortable but sound quality is poor - people on the other side of the conversation constantly claim that sound/ mic is not clear or muffled. Find an alternate hands free- piece
Jabra EarBoom for phones with Universal 2.5mm Jack: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I owned two of these EarBooms. The fit was comfortable and the sound very good. However, after a month or two of use, both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece. I imagine this came from adjusting the boom position, which put strain on the plastic. The plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress"
Jabra EarBoom for phones with Universal 2.5mm Jack: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I have no problems with how the unit feels and fits into my ear -- it's unobtrusive and light. However, I constantly get complaints from whoever I'm talking to on the phone that my voice is too quiet. I have to speak up louder than normal and cup my hand around the back of the microphone in order to produce an acceptable volume, which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset. The problem seems to be that the boom is too short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side of the mouth"
Jabra EarBoom for phones with Universal 2.5mm Jack: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable, at least for me.  It's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear, and forget about jogging wearing this.  Also the insert comes off very easily, and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears, you need to find the other sizes of the insert.  Sound quality is mediocre, as callees often complain about wind noise from my end.  I'm not happy with these"

This should be on the technical specs which are crap on this site"
Samsung t809 Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I owned Samsung T809 months ago and I was very frustrated because the bluetooth doesn't work well, sometimes it has connection (bluetooth) but most of the time it doesn't work. Yeah! it's a good looking cellphone but not a friendly user one."
Samsung t809 Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I purchased a brand new Samsung t809, and right out of the box the battery cover would not stay on the phone.  I went to a genuine T-Mobile retailer and after working on the phone for a good half-an-hour, they were still unable to get the battery cover to fit.  The sales rep had a t809 himself and was easily able to get his personal battery cover to fit.  Clearly, a manufactuering defect by Samsung.  I contacted Samsung for a replacement... after six weeks of hassling them over the issue, the end result was that ""the t809 battery cover is not included in the warranty.""  What?!  End result, I get to duct tape my battery in place.  Thanks.  If you're going to spend serious money on a high end phone... go with a brand name that actually stands behind their product.  Clearly not Samsung"
Samsung t809 Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I got this phone basically for free, but even taking that into account, I'm pretty disappointed with the phone. This is my first Samsung and, I'm pretty sure, my last one! I owned a Nokia before and I regret that I ""betrayed"" it. From now I wouldn't get anything besides Nokia and in the worst case maybe Sony-Ericsson.So here is a short list of those ""little things"" that make your life, with this phone (and it's combination with T-Mobile), annoying:- the keys are not comfortable to use.- it's not really comfortable to open/close the slider and to make it easier you have to put your thumb on the screen which leaves is greasy all the time.- putting a comma, while writing a text message, capitalizes the next word - what is the logic in that?! (it annoys me because i do use text messages a lot)- you can't set the camera shutter to be silent...- you can only save 1 phone type for each category - what if the person has 2 business phones...- you cannot choose the e-mail address of a person from the contact list when you want to send a picture message to an e-mail address.And there is a lot more of those little illogical things that were just not thought through, like it would've been in a Nokia (even in a model 5 years old!)Oh yeah, and T-Mobile really ""contributed"" to the ""greatness"" of this phone, removing some of the features and limiting others, like setting your mp3 as a ringtone (although, there is an easy hack around it: just change the extension from .mp3 to .3gp"
Samsung t809 Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I can't believe that with technology as advanced as it is, Samsung could produce this giant POS. It's flashy, yes. But does it deliver?? No. I actually refused to pay the bill and let them shut my service off. I loved the clarity of the pictures, even though the 1 megapixel camera was pretty lousy, and I even liked the video feature. But the phone is only good IF YOU CAN USE IT!!! It's been years since I've had such lousy reception from a phone. I'm considering taking the dealer to court over this, since they pushed it on me and told me what a great phone it was. I want my money back!!"
Samsung t809 Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"Has to be the worst phone I have ever had to pay for.  Between the missing features (no voice dial on a $200 phone?!) crippled features (I have to buy ringtones, use their t-zone for the WAP when I have the unlimited internet service already?) and poor reception and terrible battery life it has almost made me want to pay the early cancellation fee and find another carrier.  Anyone who would charge some much for this POS really doesn't deserve my business"
Plantronics M60 Over The Ear Headset w/ 2.5mm Plug: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"Going by the Plantronics name I bought a pair of M60 headsets to use on a cell and a miniphone. They are incredibly cheaply made, and when my wife gave them a try she got a NASTY feedback squeal several times during a long call. Essentially unusable, unless we find some trick that we have missed so far. We ordered a Sennheiser PC120 to try instead"
"Premium Vehicle Power Charger for Motorola RAZR V3, KRZR, SLVR, PEBL, and Q Phone: Cell Phones & Service",1.0,"I bought 2 charges to try and save a buck, but they are complete junk.  They worked, but never well, for about a month and then the metal charger tip totally pulled apart from the unit"
"Premium Vehicle Power Charger for Motorola RAZR V3, KRZR, SLVR, PEBL, and Q Phone: Cell Phones & Service",2.0,"I agree with most of the others, it worked okay for a couple of months... now, not only does it not charge my phone, but if I plug it into my phone, it immediately loses all charge!  It's also always falling out of the lighter plug.  I don't have that problem with any of my other chargers and I carry three chargers with me for my different gadgets"
"Premium Vehicle Power Charger for Motorola RAZR V3, KRZR, SLVR, PEBL, and Q Phone: Cell Phones & Service",1.0,"Although this charger is suggested when purchasing the Verizon Razr, the phone complains that this an ""Unauthorized Charger"" and it will not charge the phone. Do not waste your time with this"
"Premium Vehicle Power Charger for Motorola RAZR V3, KRZR, SLVR, PEBL, and Q Phone: Cell Phones & Service",1.0,"Does not work with Verizon V3C. When I plug the phone in, it says ""Unauthorized Charger"" and refuses to charge at all. It is a useless piece of junk for me considering it is supposed to be a ""charger."" I give it one star only because Amazon does not have the option for no stars. If I could, I would give it ZERO stars. I suppose that would be bad for business, but it is what it is. Avoid this cheaply made product and get the real thing. Maybe it works in China, but not in North America"
"Premium Vehicle Power Charger for Motorola RAZR V3, KRZR, SLVR, PEBL, and Q Phone: Cell Phones & Service",1.0,"A useless piece of junk.  Worked for 3 minutes then broke.  Have since bought a Motorola-brand one for three times what I paid for this piece of junk.  Do not be attracted by a cheap price tag, because you get what you pay for (or what you DONT pay for in this case). "
"Premium Vehicle Power Charger for Motorola RAZR V3, KRZR, SLVR, PEBL, and Q Phone: Cell Phones & Service",1.0,This razr car charger only worked for about 1 week then quit working.. I would not recommend this vendors products.

When plugged in, it states ""Unauthorized Charger"" and will not charge at all (although, if the battery is dead, it will give you enough juice to speak, but it still won't charge(?)).  "
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"These are not the same that come on the earbud, and are not easy to use, or to hear from.  I sent mine back"
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds.  I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one.  Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs!  If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking"
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,The service was good but the product didn't have enough info for me to make a wise decision. At the end I couldn't use the product on my jabra ear piece. The item description should have information on compatible Ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"Save your money.  The eargels split in two days.  I used regular ear buds on the large size.  They did hold the buds in the ear better, but no gain in sound quality.  If you want the small and med, I'll send them to you for shipping.  I have no use for them"
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!).  There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same).  And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece.  Every one!  It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece.  The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere.  I seriously do not recommend these to anyone"
Motorola RAZR V3 Magenta Pink Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"As others have mentioned, the front window blanks out almost immediately, and even worse, it doesn't show your missed calls.  You have to open the phone.  Stupid design.  It does not have any exterior lights, such as my old Samsung, that showed when it was charging, when charge completed, when a voice mail was waiting, etc.  This phone needs to be opened to get any info.  Can't even see the time without opening phone.While talking on phone it blacks out after about 1 minute.  I don't like that either.  It's also very hard to hear on it.  Especially if in car, with traffic noise.  No, I'm not driving, but I'm a passenger trying to use my phone.  Forget it.Re the color that someone mentioned.  Cingular is a light pastel pink, TMobile is magenta (dark pink).  The one thing I like is that this phone is a quad band, and if you travel interationally, it will be great.  I just got the phone, so haven't used it interational yet.  Oh, it must TMobile to get international service.  The phone has a camera, plus other tech features, but I don't use them.  I want my phone only to be a phone, no other gadgets.I would never buy this phone again, and as soon as I'm eligible for an upgrade this phone is history.  I doubt I would get a  Motorola ever again, I'll stick to Samsung."
Motorola RAZR V3 Magenta Pink Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I actually went through three of these phones.  Each one that I had would just turn off in the middle of a call...not just drop the call I mean the phone shuts off! Then I would try and start it again, no go! So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it. Half of the time it would start and say invalid battery and I would start the entire process over again. I complained so much to Tmobile that they exchanged it for a Motorola V360 which has all the same features, except BETTER reception and an MP3 player.  I wouldnt reccommend this phone to anyone....  p.s. My husband has the silver one and the same thing happend to his"
Motorola RAZR V3 Magenta Pink Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I was so excited to get my first ""cool"" phone. . .I've always had perfectly serviceable, but boring, cell phones and when I saw the pink Razr, I knew I wanted one.  I saved my pennies and gave myself an end-of-school-year present.I have only had this phone for a month, but I am horribly disappointed.  It has horrible reception (and I know it's not the network because I tested it side by side with other t-mobile phones) and drops more than half of my calls.  It also turns itself off ALL THE TIME - in the middle of conversation, while in your pocket, whenever.  I went back to t-mobile and they are sending me a new Samsung, but I'm sort of disappointed that my pretty pink phone didn't live up to expectations.  :"
Motorola RAZR V3 Magenta Pink Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"T-mobile has the worst customer services. Sometimes, It is the company's mistake and they still blame it on the customer. Since I started my plan, I had a problem reciving my bill on time. So, the company start charging me $5 late fee for four consecutive months. Also, when I tried adding additional features such as their text-message-bundle, the change on the account did not take effect till two days later, and I was charged for 10 cents for each message I used in these two days,and It costed me an additional $4. Every time I tried complaining to their customer services, they just wouldn't listen. I am starting to get the feeling that they are just trying to maximize their profit. More than once, if I stay long-enough on the line, they put me on mute so they don't have to listen to my complaining. I feeling that I am being treated like dirt not like a customer. I had the worst customer-services experience with t-mobile. Also, the reception is not the best in the country. I had friends who were using the same phone as the one I have but different network, and they were getting services in places where I don't have it, and they pay about the same amount of money"

Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds.  I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one.  Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs!  If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking"
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,The service was good but the product didn't have enough info for me to make a wise decision. At the end I couldn't use the product on my jabra ear piece. The item description should have information on compatible Ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"Save your money.  The eargels split in two days.  I used regular ear buds on the large size.  They did hold the buds in the ear better, but no gain in sound quality.  If you want the small and med, I'll send them to you for shipping.  I have no use for them"
Jabra EarGels - Clear: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!).  There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same).  And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece.  Every one!  It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece.  The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere.  I seriously do not recommend these to anyone"
Motorola RAZR V3 Magenta Pink Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"As others have mentioned, the front window blanks out almost immediately, and even worse, it doesn't show your missed calls.  You have to open the phone.  Stupid design.  It does not have any exterior lights, such as my old Samsung, that showed when it was charging, when charge completed, when a voice mail was waiting, etc.  This phone needs to be opened to get any info.  Can't even see the time without opening phone.While talking on phone it blacks out after about 1 minute.  I don't like that either.  It's also very hard to hear on it.  Especially if in car, with traffic noise.  No, I'm not driving, but I'm a passenger trying to use my phone.  Forget it.Re the color that someone mentioned.  Cingular is a light pastel pink, TMobile is magenta (dark pink).  The one thing I like is that this phone is a quad band, and if you travel interationally, it will be great.  I just got the phone, so haven't used it interational yet.  Oh, it must TMobile to get international service.  The phone has a camera, plus other tech features, but I don't use them.  I want my phone only to be a phone, no other gadgets.I would never buy this phone again, and as soon as I'm eligible for an upgrade this phone is history.  I doubt I would get a  Motorola ever again, I'll stick to Samsung."
Motorola RAZR V3 Magenta Pink Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I actually went through three of these phones.  Each one that I had would just turn off in the middle of a call...not just drop the call I mean the phone shuts off! Then I would try and start it again, no go! So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it. Half of the time it would start and say invalid battery and I would start the entire process over again. I complained so much to Tmobile that they exchanged it for a Motorola V360 which has all the same features, except BETTER reception and an MP3 player.  I wouldnt reccommend this phone to anyone....  p.s. My husband has the silver one and the same thing happend to his"
Motorola RAZR V3 Magenta Pink Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I was so excited to get my first ""cool"" phone. . .I've always had perfectly serviceable, but boring, cell phones and when I saw the pink Razr, I knew I wanted one.  I saved my pennies and gave myself an end-of-school-year present.I have only had this phone for a month, but I am horribly disappointed.  It has horrible reception (and I know it's not the network because I tested it side by side with other t-mobile phones) and drops more than half of my calls.  It also turns itself off ALL THE TIME - in the middle of conversation, while in your pocket, whenever.  I went back to t-mobile and they are sending me a new Samsung, but I'm sort of disappointed that my pretty pink phone didn't live up to expectations.  :"
Motorola RAZR V3 Magenta Pink Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"T-mobile has the worst customer services. Sometimes, It is the company's mistake and they still blame it on the customer. Since I started my plan, I had a problem reciving my bill on time. So, the company start charging me $5 late fee for four consecutive months. Also, when I tried adding additional features such as their text-message-bundle, the change on the account did not take effect till two days later, and I was charged for 10 cents for each message I used in these two days,and It costed me an additional $4. Every time I tried complaining to their customer services, they just wouldn't listen. I am starting to get the feeling that they are just trying to maximize their profit. More than once, if I stay long-enough on the line, they put me on mute so they don't have to listen to my complaining. I feeling that I am being treated like dirt not like a customer. I had the worst customer-services experience with t-mobile. Also, the reception is not the best in the country. I had friends who were using the same phone as the one I have but different network, and they were getting services in places where I don't have it, and they pay about the same amount of money"

Body Glove Scuba II Cellsuit for Motorola i860 - Black/Blue: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,This case does not work well. The case blocks the camera eye and the clip lasted one week
Body Glove Scuba II Cellsuit for Motorola i860 - Black/Blue: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"Whereas the body glove cosmetically looks good, it has a diabolical flaw inherent in its POOR design. The attachment button that is mounted on the rear of the glove that allows quick engagement and disengagement to the belt clip is seriously defective. The plastic button resides in a small pocket sewn into the rear of the glove. The problem is that the button flange that holds the button connector to the glove is floating inside of the rubber elastic glove. The pocket stretches! As soon as any pressure is applied to the phone when it is hanging on your belt (like when you sit down or bump anything), the connector easily (and silently) dislodges from its elastic pocket!!! Your valuable cell phone drops to the ground and you have lost it! You have lost your phone but the button is still attached to your belt clip. This is a dreadfully constructed device that the designer should be ashamed of. Use this glove at your own peril"
Body Glove Scuba II Cellsuit for Motorola i860 - Black/Blue: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"Looks nice, protects the i860 very well.  But... I've only had it for 3 months, the release broke off after 2 months which I rarely used.  The swivel spins freely now and no longer rachets.  The cover for the screen housing gets in the way of the camera, it has to be held down away from the lense.  Body Glove needs to send this one back to the engineers"

Samsung A820 Prepaid Phone (STi Mobile) : Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I've previously had subscription cell phone services with a variety of providers, but found I rarely used the number of minutes I was paying for.  A prepaid phone service seemed like the way to go, and STI Mobile sounded like a good alternative because the price was competitive and minutes don't expire.  I signed up and shortly after received my Samsung phone.  It arrived, however, defective - the port for recharging the phone was damaged.  Per the STI Mobile web site, I contacted them within 14 days to arrange for a replacement phone.  This resulted in a number of email exchanges with customer service.  In the first one, the rep told me that I was mistaken, and must have been sent the wrong charger.  No offer was made to replace the charger, strangely, which was included as part of the package deal.  After additional emails where I reassured her that I did in fact have the right charger (I took the phone in to a local merchant, who showed me the charger I was shipped worked with an identical model phone - it was the port on the shipped phone that was defective).  At this point, the rep apologized and told me I would have to contact Samsung for a replacement phone!  This entire process took several weeks.In short, I guess you get what you pay for.  If I had been shipped a working phone STI Mobile probably would have met my needs, but I was turned off by the poor customer service and have since found another prepaid phone provider"
Motorola Razr V3 Swivel Belt Clip Holster - Black (Face Out): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,Worthless. It rips off your battery door when you try to take the phone off. Flimsy and broke within a week. Not even worth the 0.01 I paid for it which is sad. :
Motorola Razr V3 Swivel Belt Clip Holster - Black (Face Out): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,Poorly made and weak. Pulls the battery off my RAZR everytime I disconnect it from the holder. Stopped using it within a day after purchase. There are better holsters for the RAZR on the market. Avoid this one

Motorola V171 Prepaid Phone (NET10): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"My Motorola C139 with Net10 crashed on me.  I called Net10 and they promptly sent me out a new phone, except they sent me this flip phone (V171).  I liked my candy bar phone and didn't want this flip piece of junk.  I was happy with Net10 service up to the point of my old phone failing, and then things quickly went downhill.  Net10 would not transfer my number to the replacement phone, even though I had minutes available on the old phone.  I gave my wife the V171 to use and took back from her our Cingular phone, which works awesome with no problems.  She had problems all the time with the V171.  She had to always type in the area codes for all numbers dialed, even the local numbers.  She also had problems trying to dial a number and the phone would not dial after pressing all the numbers in the phone and hitting send.  In my opinion, the V171 is completely worthless.Overall, I am a very dissatisfied customer.  My recommendation is to stay away from this phone and this service.  Go shop Cingular for all the great deals they have"

Three-Piece Value Combo Pack for Nokia 6230: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,I wouldn't recommend this product to any one. The phone cover really sucks. I just used this product for a month....and the clip cover peeled off....really disappointed with this purchase.
Three-Piece Value Combo Pack for Nokia 6230: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I agree on ""it was too good to be true"" statement for this package.The material used for earbud and the charger is really cheap !. The charger melted in the car after a sunny day, I couldn't even test it. Earphone quality is not good as well, giving a constant humming noise. The case is the best out of these three so far. So one out of three for 10 bucks. I am not recommending anyone to buy this item. "

Three-Piece Value Combo Pack for Nokia 6230: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"This deal was too good to be true. Of course I wasn't expecting any name brand stuff here, but at least I expected them to all work. I don't know if I got a bad earbud or what, but it adds static and noise and therefore cannot be used.The case I didn't need, but it does fit well and looks to be decently constructed. The power adapter seems to work fine. So basically I spent $9.99 and am only using the power adapter. I guess that's a good enough deal. I think I'll go spend some extra money and get a brand name earbud/headset though"
Cardo Systems scala-500 Bluetooth Headset - Red: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I recently purchased this bluetooth Scala-500 and used it all about maybe 5 times.  Why such a short amount of time?  Because the sound quality heard on the other end is so poor that I am told it sounds like I am in a windy tunnel when in fact I am in the car with the windows up and radio off.  It's a bit too hot to drive with air condition off and windows up just so the person on  the other end can hear me.  Now I keep this piece of junk in my console and will only use it if my Logitech bluetooth is out of power.  If you buy this make sure you plan to use it in a place like a library where there are no sounds at all to interfere.  The only good thing about this headset is that it was easy to setup and connects well with my cell phone.  Think twice about buying this product or check it out at your local retailer first.  Even with the rebate I only paid $[...], but still not a bargain.  The one star was for the ease of setting up with my cell phone"
Black Plastic Swivel Belt Clip Holster for Sony Ericsson Z525 / Z525a / Z525i / Z520/Z520a: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"As soon as I bought it I realized it doesn't hold the phone too well. Few days later my concerns proved them selves, every time I made a rapid movement or tried to run with it (even very carefully) the phone would unclamp itself from the holster and slam into the ground. Every time I was lucky to realize as soon as I droped it, untill today when after coming home from shoping I realized my z520a is no longer with me. There goes a $200 phone, lost because of a stupid $10 holster.  Do not buy this product, if you realy need a holster go with something like Sonyericsson's ""ICE-26"" that secures the phone with an extra flap on top so it dosn't slip out of the holster. As for me I gatta get me a new phone, shame I had the Z520 cell phone for about 4 months now and I really liked it"
Treo 650 SkinTight w/ Holster - Black: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"The skin is a great idea, but it is not practical.  It is too thick to work with the Seidio Cradle I have, so I must pull off the skin to sync my Treo.  The skin buttons do not always line up with the TREO buttons, so I misfire applications.  The holster is a joke as it snaps over top the expansion card slot constantly ejecting the card every time I pull the phone off the holster.  Do not place the phone in your pocket with the skin on unless you need to see the inside of your pocket liner as it will not come out cleanly"
Treo 650 SkinTight w/ Holster - Black: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I was looking forward to the Speck rubberized cover with some excitement, however I was disappointed.  While the cover fits very well it and may work in an industrial environment, after the first day it looks like it's two years old.  If you have an SD card in your Treo forget it -- the belt clip will pop your card daily.  And the belt clip itself is an afterthought easily sliding off your belt.  Don't even think about putting the Treo in your pocket as the non-slip cover won't begin to slide into your pocket.  Finally, the price at $32.95 is outrageous for a $5 cover.  If you're in an industrial enviroment this may be your cover, but for the rest of us...keep shopping or buy insurance"
Treo 650 SkinTight w/ Holster - Black: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"The SkinTight cover is cool. Works pretty well with the unit, but the belt clip SUCKS! It's big and bulky and locks in over the mute switch on the Treo and it sometimes slides the mute switch over to mute or vise versa."

3 Piece Starter Kit for Motorola V220: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,This stuff isn't even worth $14.99.  My husband and my aunt couldn't even hear me.  It's a piece of crap. I sent it back the same day.  DON'T BUY IT!!
Sanyo SCP-6600 Katana Cherry Blossom Phone (Sprint): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!  I have had this phone for 6 months, and I am SO disappointed!  Of course it worked for the first 30 days (within the grace period), but then I began having problems with keeping the battery charged.  I took it to the local Sprint store, and they gave me a new battery.  That worked for a few weeks, but just recently I've started having the same problem.  I just spent over 2 hours on the phone (of course not MY phone--I had to use my work time) with Sprint and Sanyo.  Of course, neither company was willing to stand behind the product, so now I have to send the phone (at my expense, of course) to Sanyo to have it repaired, which will take two weeks, at least.  So please, do yourselves a favor, and pick out a different phone"
Sanyo SCP-6600 Katana Cherry Blossom Phone (Sprint): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I was with Sprint for almost 10 years, all told. I had a picture mail account with them for about 3 years. Just recently, without any warning, whatsoever, they deleted over 500 of my precious pictures from my picture mail account...pics that had been accumulating and many of which had been safely and soundly sitting there for most of that period of time.  Most of these pics were VERY important to me and are now lost forever.(I had only backed up about 45 of them.) I guess it was my own fault for trusting Sprint, but they offered no real explanation and when I tried to have the pics recovered, not only could they not do that, but they said they had NO RECORD of me ever having the picture account that I had with them for almost three years!!! This is the worst thing any service company has ever done to me! So, my advice: DON'T TRUST SPRINT!!! Again, this happened with any warning! It could happen to you too!

Samsung T809 Stereo Earbud Headset with Send End Button: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I read the other review about these falling out of the reviewer's ear...  I figured at this price, I'd try for my wife and I.  When I first tried them on, I instantly realized that the other reviewer was dead on.  Even with the provided clip, these fall out and you're better off not using them.  Frustrating that all these cell phone companies are now going to proprietary jacks on cell phones.  Two stars only because they do work if you hold them with your hands and they were inexpensive. "
Samsung T809 Stereo Earbud Headset with Send End Button: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"Samsung has a great phone with the Black Jack.  Unfortunately, the headset jack is not a standard jack, but instead one unique to Samsung phones.  Therefore, you are forced to buy Samsung's headset.  Bottom line -- don't bother.  The design is horrible.  The earbuds don't stay in the ear.  What makes matters worse is that each ear bud has a rigid teardrop of about an inch and half that connects to the cord.  Any pressure or movement on the teardrop say from clothing or hair pushes the ear bud out of your ear.  I hope that Samsung creates an adapter to fit in the jack that will allow you to use regular headphones. "

LG HBM-300 Bluetooth Headset (Black): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I got this for Cyber Monday for $20 too.  I thought I couldn't go wrong for $20.  Well, I was wrong--it was twenty dollars completely wasted.  I'd feel bad giving this POS away...  I could not get the thing to stay put, the boom mike is so bottom-heavy that it won't stay close to my cheek even sitting still!  And it pokes out about 3 feet to the side of my head (it seems like it anyway) if I am moving around at all!  Almost like it was DESIGNED to get as far away from my voice as possible.  But even holding the stupid thing with my hand did not help the sound quality.  I got constant complaints that I could not be heard very well.There are only a couple things saving this from a 1 star rating.  First, I did only pay $20 for it.  Second, it's a decent quality, just piss-poor design.  And three, I liked that when I clicked the button (not due to incoming call), it automatically launched the voice dial menu, so I could really make a call without ever touching my cell phone.  I guess that is one of the perks of having the same mfr for both headset and phone. But it fails miserably at it's primary design goal, so I heartily recommend staying away from this product"

Motorola KRZR K1 myFaves Silver Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one!! You can't see anything in the outer window, especially in the sun light. So you can't see who's calling or what time it is without opening the phone. It hurts your ear when talking. The buttons are difficult to push.

Thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool'. I returned it and got my money back"
Ratcheting Swivel Belt Holster for Motorola V220: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"This holster offer's your phone ZERO protection.  Not to mention the fact that bumping into something can oftern knock the phone out of the holster.  While it does allow the phone to swivel, thus avoiding being stabbed by the antenna when seated, I ended up being the stabbing victim of the belt clip instead.Not to mention the wear and tear from the phone hitting the pavement.All in all, I would NOT recommend this holster.  I'm shopping for a holster and faceplate as we speak.."
Ratcheting Swivel Belt Holster for Motorola V220: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"While this is a functional holster, be aware that you may -- like me - find that your phone hangs up as you extract it from the holster.  I know, I know.  You can turn off the ""answer phone when opened"" option, but that is not preferred by everyone.You may also find that the phone does not stay in the holster securely."
Starcom Slice Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,I chose Virgin Mobile thinking they would be a good company. I have never been treated so rudely by customer service people in my life. In multiple conversations and speaking to numerous people I never got the same answer twice. It was a nightmare.I ended up throwing away the phone and losing my money. I feel stolen from.I would never do business with this company again. Huge mistake in the first place
Kangaroo Universal Accessory Case for Cell Phones - Black/Gray Argyle: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I'm writing a review for the first time because I've never been so dissapointed with a shopping experience. I bought cell phone cases from World of Bags so that I could give them as Christmas gifts. I ordered them on December 5th. It took them until December 19th to confirm that they were being shipped! It was as if they were waiting for the last minute to ship me my items. [Amazon has a two week policy for shipment of products.] Needless to say, I did not get to give them away as Christmas gifts. This is the type of service I got for choosing standard shipping -which was very expensive to send two little cell phone cases(I can't specify how much because they won't let me post prices in reviews)! They also shipped them seperately. A sign of inefficiecy, indeed. One came in an appropriately sized bubble envelope and the other in a huge box. I've decided to not return the items because I want to cut my losses now and just never order from them again"
Blackberry 7290/7230 SkinTight w/ Holster- Black: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"Great concept: protective rubber skin that protects the BlackBerry unit from accidental drops and scratches.  The rubbery material tends to collect all sorts of dust and lint.  It's very hard to get it off (unless you wash it with water or use tape to peel it off).  The protective cover doesn't fit around the screen too well.  Mine tends to be stretched out a little more on the left side than on the right (even if I try and reposition the unit itself).  The plastic screen cover (that can be removed) was already scratched due to the way it is packaged.  All in all, I am pretty disappointed... mainly because I paid over $33 for it.  It's now sitting on my desk at work collecting dust"

RED RUBBERIZED PROGUARD (WITH BELT CLIP) COVER SNAP-ON CASE for PALM ONE TREO 650 / 700: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"This phone case is the worse one ever for the TREO 650. Yea the color is great but, if you just tap it on the ground or anything the color comes off wit ease.  The screen protector is not that great either.  A piece of plastic over the screen.... You have to lift it up so now you have a piece of 2 cent plastic over a five hundred dollar phone.  Not smart.  Now there was someone who likes this cheap piece of plastic over the screen to protect it. Quote ""It attaches easily and I especially like the screen cover - most cases don't have this (if you drop the phone and crack the screen, you're hosed)."" Well about this statement. Insurance!!! If you invest in a five hundred dollar phone then you must have insurance on it.  So, I guess you are not hosed in the end.  Final:  I am very disappointed in the cover and recommend that you invest in another product (leather).  I bought this item hoping to have something different.  The sale price is really what it is worth.  Six bucks....  $6.00 on a $500.00 phone.... My bad.. I really should have tough about this one and this is a warning to others.  How cheesy... I tough I was getting a deal"
Insten - 3.5mm Plug Headset Adapter with Switch for Palm Treo 650 / 680 / 700 / 700w / 700p / 700wx / 750v smartphone by Eforcity: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I bought three of these at once - and they all were fine for being an adapter to a 3.5mm headset for listening to music, but they didn't handle calls at all - everything is full of static, listening and talking. I just placed a call with it, and the person who answered immediately told me to call back that the connection was terrible, but it was the adapter that was the problem, full of static and echo. I would never use these for calls"
Samsung A670 Phone (Verizon Wireless): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I enjoyed using this phone for some time.  It was functional, it felt solid, and it had a nice low profile look. However, after around a year and a half, the continued act of opening and closing the phone has caused the hinge to crack, and to gradually break off completely.  I now have to hold the phone together with my hand while I talk, which is extremely awkward.  This is especially frustrating given the rest of the phone is so well made.  Furthermore, it seems to have unfortunately failed just before my ""upgrade"" opportunity (in a couple of months), and right after my purchase of some extra accessories (batteries/chargers).  Search around online for ""a670 hinge"" and you will find a lot of other people with problems like mine.  This in itself wouldn't be a problem if Samsung would willingly replace the phone.  However, they are not claiming it as a design defect, and neither Samsung nor Verizon are offering to replace it.  Bad form for both, although perhaps Verizon isn't as much to blame.I would avoid both Samsung and this phone because of this incident.  This phone is seemingly designed to be durable, but it frankly is not meant for the long haul, and is too pricey given its average performance. "
Samsung A670 Phone (Verizon Wireless): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"Samsung A670 is a lame phone. Also, the battery life is not good. It didn't have many features so its just a waste of your money. The Ringtone Volume was too low. I would suggest Samsung improved this phone. I am not sure if i ever want another Samusung again. I have all these samsung accessories and they are in no use they just sitting in the box colleting dust."

Palm Treo 650 Crystal Clear Hard Case with Belt Clip: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"This worked for only a couple days.

I've been trying for 4 weeks to transfer my old phone number to my new Tracfone.  It's been a nightmare-after 4 weeks, 3 new sim cards, and countless calls to TracFone customer service reps, I've accomplished nothing.  My phone is still not activated, I still don't have my old number transfered, and I've wasted 7 hours speaking to customer reps.  I don't recommend TracFone"

Once it was charged I went to activate the phone, it said ""insert sim"". I redid several times, called support, got the run around, becaused it did not understand my error. When I got a person, she said the same thing, after 15 minutes of trying to insert a card where there was no place for a card, the lady said they would have to send me a new phone, mind was broke. So we will see if the new one is better, next week when it comes"
LG C1500 Phone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"We've had 3 of the LG1500 in our family plan for nearly a year.  Very inconsistent service.  When calling our son, I would get a message that his number was ""blacklisted"".  After calling Cingular several times, we demanded new phones...not LG1500.  We were told it was ""like for like"" exchange, but that policy is not in writing...so we're getting a different brand.  If a phone doesn't work, the company needs to get rid of them!"
LG C1500 Phone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I got the phone because it was small but I didn't know I'd be sacrificing so much. The speakerphone only works when the call picks up and my text message inbox fills up basically every day. I get shoddy service and while i do like the design, there are lots of places where the paint has chipped away and I can see thru to the casing. All in all an okay phone if all you want it for is emergencies, but it's not really the best for what you'll want to do with your cell phone."
LG C1500 Phone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I paid 10 dollars for this phone and have spent almost 40 on sim cards. The phone will say ""Insert SIM Card"" even if it is inside. It recyles, and when it does so, the screen goes blank and if you were talking on the phone your call is dropped. There is a VERY minimal selection of graphics, ringtones, and games.  You cannot change the mini display. Save your money because you might end up spending 40-50 bucks on SIM cards, and another 50 for a replacement phone."
LG C1500 Phone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"My wife and I got two of these phones for ""free"" when she switched to Cingular. After two weeks, we exchanged her phone for a new one of the same model because it would freeze and drop calls constantly. My phone was fine, but has lately been experiencing the same issues. I know service is not the problem as I had a Samsung phone through Cingular before and had no problems calling from the same areas. Sometimes I'll have 5 bars and all of the sudden it goes to 0 and takes a minute or two to come back.I do not recommend this phone. Even though it is/was free, it's not worth the frustration"
LG C1500 Phone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I got this phone in January, and I had to take it back the day I got it because it kept losing service and dropping calls.

Don't buy this phone"
LG C1500 Phone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"This has to be the worst phone I've ever owned.  I thought Motorola StarTac (my very first phone) was bad, wait till use this phone.  I have 4 LG C1500 phones in my family plan.  2 works ok but the other two, where do I begin.  First, it keeps complaining to insert sim card although it's inserted properly.  Went to Cingular store got the new sim card, works ok for a day.  Next day, same thing.  Did this 3 times and had Cingular send me the replacement phones.  Now one of the two doesn't complain about the sim card but occationally it says it's not in the network although it shows full bars.  The other one still have problem with sim card.  I just got the third replacement phone and now it seemed to be ok with sim card issue but can't talk more than a minute.  It just drops a call in the middle of conversation.  I now am trying to get a 4th replacement phone but not sure if they will issue it.  I am under 2 year contract and still got 14 months to go, what a nightmare..."
LG C1500 Phone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"We bought 2 phones on a family plan last October.  We were looking for a very basic flip phone capability, no bells and whistles needed.  Our major use was to communicate between each other.  We were happy for for about 5 months.  Since then we have experienced all the problems mentioned.  Our phones were replaced during April. One sim card was replaced during June. Yesterday we again replaced our sim card on the same phone.  Another replacement phone is on the way to us.  The major problems have included ""service not available"" even though 4 bars are showing and the other phone works at the same location, ""unable to read"", ""insert card"", and of course dropped calls.  Yesterday as I was talking to a warrantee agent trying to resolve our most recent problem my call was dropped in the middle of the call.  At this point I have concluded that this model is extremely unreliable and am looking for an alternative solution.  I can not depend on it.  I would not recommend it to anyone"

Nokia N80 Internet Edition Black Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"Excellent high-res LCD, but the rest of the phone was a disappointment. Poor overall interface with configuration options in non-intuitive locations. Particularly disappointing was how it handled WiFi. Each application seemed to want to be tied to a particular wireless source. So, I'd go home and try to get it on the wireless, but I'd have to bring up the app, let it spin a while, be told it couldn't connect, then I'd have to tell it to use the local WiFi. It was just clunky. The poor utility of things like WiFi mean that this is unlikely to be used as anything beyond a phone, and a very expensive an bulky one at that.I can check and respond to email far faster on my BlackBerry than I could get this thing to get an appication running and connected via WiFi. Much better WiFi management is a must before I'd consider this phone.This is a serious example of one device trying to do everything, and doing nothing very well.

I don't want this because I like charging at night, the other chargers don't do this (I guess what it does is it starts fluctuating power from the wall, like switching off, when the battery is fully charged..so it beeps as if it's being plugged in over and over).When I first got it, I was trying to carefully plug it into my phone--and I didn't want to damage the little metal things inside my phone OR on the charger.  It wasn't going in smoothly and it didn't match up or seem to fit inside at ALL.  So I went a day without a phone and I did more research to see why the heck they'd lie that it fit my phone.  Finally I got fed up because I couldn't find another charger ANYWHERE where I live and I tried forcing it.FINALLY it fit!  But I had to shove it in.. who knows if it was damaging my phone.  But it was charging so I was happy (my cell is my only phone.. so I was cut off from the world).  Then I tried getting it out and couldn't figure it out!  I had to jimmy it off, and broke off one of the side hooks that helps it secure itself.  I was able to put it back on, and finally learned a routine so to speak, for taking it off, but it's cheap.  It's very cheap.So, the charger works, but it's very hard to use and it isn't convenient at all.  I don't recommend it unless it's an emergency.  For me, it was"

Motorola V180 Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I had to return this phone twice to Motorola for keys that weren't working.  It was too frustrating.Can't use the phone in my house or at work although my prior Nokia worked well. There are some nice things -- but these are externals and certainly not explained in the user manual.--customisation of the front screen is do-able.--there's a composer in the phone to compose your own ringtone.  No mention in the user manual.  Stumbled across it.--Ringtones are expensive to buy from Cingular.  First you pay for the ringtone and then you pay for the access to the internet to download it.  A double payment.  The saving grace was the ability to send the ringtones to myself by searching for methods on the internet.  --The volume was always frustrating.  I was unable to find a ringtone loud enough so that i could hear the phone when it's in my purse.  Volume controls are easy.  However putting the phone on vibrate was buried in the menus and not in the user manual.  Counterbalanced by the ability to put an icon on the front screen so i could easily change it to vibrate.  -- I especially hate how loud the phone is when you go to turn it off in a theater.  You're being responsible and the phone does that annoying Moto noise.  It's only silent when you shut it down from silent ringing.  Yet to set it on silent ringing using the side buttons, you get noisy tones as you lower the volume"

Palm Treo 600 PDA Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"Hi,Before buying this phone from Amazon, I called Palm and they told me that there would be a 1 year warranty on this item as long it is new. I subsequently bought this unlocked version of the phone and I am using it on the T-Mobile network.I now have a problem on the display within 2 months of purchase. I call Palm and after multiple run arounds with tech support, they asked me to read out my serial number. It starts with a HAGA which, they indicate, means that it has to be on the AT&T Wireless Network. According to them, I am in violation of the warranty since I am using it on the T-Mobile network. How am I know what the serial number on the back of the phone means prior to my purchase? If I am purchasing a GSM unlocked phone, obviously I need the flexibility to move to a different network.Palm is taking the easy way out - they want you to buy an unlocked phone from their site and not from Amazon. Amazon, itself, does not provide any warranty.If any of you have had better luck with Palm or have any suggestions - please let me know.Thank"

Cingular 8525 Armor Case - The Metal Case (Black): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"Advantages:1) Superior protection: I have dropped my phone twice onto concrete and there has been no damage to phone or case.2) All buttons accessible, though a bit difficult to get to in cases.Disadvantages:1) Signal quality is worse when the phone is in the case!  2) Belt clip useless, since the case can easily open, spilling out the phone when on one's belt.  3) Side ""ok"" button difficult to press, same with top two front front buttons (above ""start"" and ""ok"" buttons).Summary: Usable only for protection during transportation, and does this well.Phone should be removed from case during usage"
Cingular 8525 Armor Case - The Metal Case (Black): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"When I recieved this item, I had mixed emotions for the product. On one hand, the black finish looked very nice, and the clear plastic covering protected the screen but was still easy to read. Also, all of the side buttons are fairly easy to reach with average-sized fingers (except maybe the camera button), so navigating the phone with the cover still closed is pretty easy unless you need to use touch functions or open the QWERTY keyboard.However, due to the padding and the nature of the metal materials, the case is very thick and bulky - when using the belt clip, the phone sticks out far enough that it does not even rest evenly on your hip, but leans at an angle.BUT, the deciding factor in my two-star rating is that this case was the cause of the only two times I have dropped my Cingular 8525 (which at such a steep price, is not something I like to drop). The problem lies with the snap-shut system that closes the case. Because the metal is so thin, it does not secure very well, and can come open pretty easily. To fix this, I simply bent the piece of metal downward and towards the phone, so that it was much harder to both open and close the case. This, for the most part, solves the problem, but it is still dangerous and caution is DEFINATELY in order.My favorite thing about this case is that you can open the case and slide the keyboard open without actually taking the phone out of the case. This is nice because it enable quick replies to text messages. This is the only reason I did not give it a one-star rating. I am currently looking for a soft case, preferably a leather sleeve case that I can just pull my phone out of off of my hip, rather than bother with a clip anymore.As a final warning - BE CAREFUL if you buy this case. Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point"
Cingular 8525 Armor Case - The Metal Case (Black): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"Let me count the ways this thing let me down:1. You have to open it to slide out the full keyboard, making it vulnerable to damage2. It doesn't matter whether you open the case or not. If it drops, the case falls right open anyway, spilling your device on to whatever hard surface you were trying to protect the 8525 from.3. The case is so heavy that it feels like it doubles the weight of the device and sticks out too far when you wear it.4. The case is so bulky that it ensures you will catch on something, and dropping everything on to the ground to be damaged (at least that's what happened to me).Super disappointed in this product, in case you couldn't tell"

Cingular 8525 Armor Case - The Metal Case (Black): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"Originally, I purchased this heavy-duty case to protect my new expensive 8525.  However, wearing the case on my belt with the belt clip, my phone fell out of the case several times when the case cover accidentally opened up.  Luckily the phone was not functionally damaged, but I have several big dents and scratches on the case.  I'm going to stop using a case now, since the phone is now already beat-up.The latch mechanism for the cover will loosen up with use, especially since you'll have to open and close it repeatedly to access the touch screen.  Also, it took a bit getting used to, to have to open the case to make a phone call.The overall quality of this case is very good tho, because it fits the phone very snuggly and the holes line up to all the buttons.I guess its a great case if you don't wear it on your belt.  But I can't justify such a huge case if I carry it in my pocket."

Motorola V360 Phone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"Prior to buying this phone I had heard a lot of people say that Motorola's hardware was very good, but that their software left a lot to be desired.  Nonetheless I decided to try this phone out when it came time to start a new cell plan.  I had made the decision to switch to T-mobile and this looked like one of the best phone options.  Right off the bat I found out that the people who criticized Moto's software were right on the money.  There are a host of poorly designed software aspects of this phone, not the least of which is the -- frankly -- idiotic way the phone book is designed.  Eventually I made peace with all of the things I disliked about the V360 since at least it seemed to work well enough as a phone.  As time went by I started noticing that I was missing a lot of calls.  The phone would be in my bag or in my pocket or sitting on my desk when suddenly it would ring with the voicemail notification from a message that I had received anywhere from minutes to hours before.  During the course of the last few months (the phone is less than a year old) I've also found that it has begun crashing.  A lot.  Opening or closing it will result in a ""white screen of death.""  Putting it on the charger will cause it to switch back and forth between the messages that it is charging, that it is unable to charge and that it's SIM card cannot be found, after a few minutes of which it will simply shut itself off.  With a full battery charge it will continually shut itself off.  At this point I am forced to conclude that this phone is an absolute piece of junk.  I am also forced to conclude that it isn't the only model which is.  None of my coworkers has ever had a good experience with a Motorola phone.  My wife's Motorola has shown its own host of problems.  People working for T-mobile at several stores I have visited have confided that they never, ever recommend Motorola phones to anyone.  In fact I've had T-mobile employees urge me to not buy any phones from them, but rather to shop for an unlocked Nokia online.  So that's what I'm going to do.  Until I can buy a new phone all I can do is recharge this phone every night, restart it five or six times a day, and keep apologizing to my friends, family and employers for always missing their calls"
Motorola HS805 Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"The sound is low, static-ky, and it frequently dropped calls. Boo."
Motorola HS805 Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I got the HS805 to call home while trucking. I was sold on the AAA battery power source, because the rechargeable ones won't last on a 14 hour work shift and even then I have no 120V outlet to recharge.However, I have to say the audio output when adjusted to max volume is barely audible in an 18 wheeler at highway speeds. The wind and engine noise is much higher than in a car and similar to that heard in a 757 at 35000ft. For this reason alone, this headset is JUNK. The advertisements criminally overstate the talk and standby time as well. With a regular new Duracell AAA battery, I get a low battery tone after about 1 hour of standby. And with a 900mAh Duracell Rechargeable battery I get only 6 hours of standby time before hearing the low battery tone. As for the marketing department at Motorolla, I have to say GREAT JOB for deceiving and misrepresenting an inferior product that lacks stated function and durability. I hope you enjoy earning a check based on lying to people. Hint: Get a job that actually contributes to society versus fleecing society. You should be proud!"

Motorola RAZR V3c Pink Phone (Verizon Wireless): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"i hate this phone.  i moved to miami and cannot get reception anywhere. it  cuts me off the minute i enter any building so i am stuck standing outside to talk.  i had to get a land line for the first time in over 5 years because i cannot use it in my apartment, so i am wasting tons of money on a land line with overpriced long distance rates.  but here's the thing:  other people on verizon using a different brand phone like LG have absolutely no problem!  they actually get a couple bars of reception, whereas i always have one or none at all.  i returned the phone and all they could do was give me another just like it... with all the same problems.  i actually had over 30 dropped calls in one month.  i am now stuck with it for the next 2 years unless i want to purchase another one for full price.  on top of that, people are right when they say the battery life is ridiculous.  unless you never talk on it, the battery wears out in a hurry.  and the volume buttons on the side are very hard to use when talking.  i usually end up putting it on speaker phone by accident.  i am trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils.. chucking this one in the drawer and purchasing a different one, or wasting money on a land line.  whatever you do, don't get suckered in by it's cute pink color, because underneath it's pretty exterior it's junk"
Motorola RAZR V3c Pink Phone (Verizon Wireless): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I'm not a huge fan of this phone.  I got it because I needed a new phone, it was only 40 bucks and, it's pink.  1.  The battery life on this phone is TERRIBLE.  T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E.  Yesterday, after charging the phone the ENTIRE night, took it off the charger about 8am for work.  I made a 5 minute phone call, a 6 minute phone call, entered a number into my contacts, entered an event into my calendar, received a text message and made a 3 minute phone call and the phone started bleeping ""low battery""!!!!!2. The ringtones are SOOOOOOO crappy.  Remember the ringtones on cell phones 10 years ago?  That's what is here.3. The date and time don't continuously display on the outside screen.  I don't have a clock in my office (I have a very small office and work for a non-profit) and I don't wear a watch, I'm constantly opening my phone to see the time, it's ridiculous.4.  The battery life is TERRIBLE.The good thing about this phone so far:Great reception.  I hear people very clearly for the 6 minutes I am able to speak to them before the battery goes dead.

Motorola RAZR V3c Pink Phone (Verizon Wireless): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"After my Nextel phone started acting up, I decided to switch services because I liked the Razr style and a lot of people I was calling were already on Verizon so the ""In"" calling was a bonus. I have had this phone all of 3 days and already miss my Motorola i860. You can import only a couple of MP3s before the phones memory is full, unless you buy their $50 transflash card (1 gig is the largest). Then, you cannot assign the MP3s you import as ringtones either, a major disappointment for me - again missing my i860 with its 400+ ringtones that I imported from random WAV, midi and MP3 files. You cannot change the softkeys on the main menu either and the calendar is hard to input events (you have to set a reminder for all, there is no option for no reminder). All in all, not what I grew accustomed to with my i860.  I'm already thinking the $175 early term charge is a bargain compared to what I will spend over the life of my 2-year contract. And that leads me to another rip-off with Verizon, they charge you an extra $35 to sign only a one-year term! Next time I'll read the fine print, and just upgrade my Nextel"

Motorola RAZR V3c Pink Phone (Verizon Wireless): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,I am terribly disappointed with my RAZR V3c phone.  I purchased it for the bluetooth capability and the size and color which are the ONLY positive features.  The viewing screen is so small that I can't even read the time and it does not give the option to use larger font size.   The battery dies about three hours after being charged even if I haven't used the phone.  It does not give me the ability to automatically call back someone who left a message unless that person also has Verizon service.  I am forced to enter a code in order to hear my messages and I can't find any way change this.  I wish I had my old Sprint phone again.

RIM Blackberry 8700 series Plastic Swivel Holster Black (ACC-10364-001): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"This is a very basic holster, and often simple is best - but not this time. The good news: the 8700 slips right in and out with ease, the swivel works great, and the clip is reasonably secure. A minor issue, becuase its plastic, when the virbrate ""ring"" is active, it makes an annoying rattle sound. The real problem is that the 8700 is held in the case by two flimsy plastic tabs (one on each side). Everyday use must weaken the plastic, becuase after about two months one of these tabs broke on my case, which meant that they 8700 would not stay put. It slipped out and fell to the floor several times. I replaced the case, and a month later, the tabs on the new case broke too. Due to cheap build quality, I'd suggest you look at third-party case options instead of this one. "

It'll split lightweight stuff like cell phones, but don't trust anything more demanding than that with this splitter.  I hooked my laptop up through it and the fuse blew within one second.  Sadly, I'd bought four of these since shipping cost as much as the item itself, and ALL FOUR died when I tried them with my laptop.  The back of the package says not to use items that use over a total of 10amps, which seemed reasonable, so I got out my ammeter and figured out that my laptop used 6amps at most, so not only is this busted, but they lie on the package.  I managed to open up the splitter and put in some more heavy duty wiring and a stronger fuse, and then it worked for a short time until I started smelling plastic melting -- it turns out even one of the springs inside couldn't handle 6amps and heated up enough to disfigure and melt plastic around it.

Motorola i530 Yellow Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message ""network not available"". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end. Don't make the same mistake I did."
Motorola i560 Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"My wife and I both got this phone at the same time.  I chose it because it claims to be rugged, and the price was right.  Well, we have had them for around six months, and they are both not working right.  My wife took hers to one of those stores in the mall that can change the case, so her i560 now wears pink.  Shortly after, it started resetting itself randomly.  She would pick it up, just to find that she needed to enter the SIM password.  Over time it started doing it more and more.  At first I believed that it might be due to damage done from the case change, but later my phone started doing the same thing.  Now, my phone will reset itself at least four or five times a day.  I absolutely cannot believe that such a product is even being sold with such a bad defect.  Anybody can ship one bad product, but to get two phones with the same problem is unforgivable.  Shame on Motorola"
Motorola i560 Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I purchased 2 i560 phones - one for me and one for my husband.  Brand new out of the box, 1 of them had a bad microphone (you could hear the person talking, but they couldn't hear you).  Nextel & Motorolla wanted me to send the phone in for repair and be without it for 15 days - but I raised a stink and finally got it replaced (since it was broke from day 1, I didn't want a ""serviced"" phone).Here we are 3 months later, 1 of the phones has a bad microphone - AGAIN, and the other phone's keypad just went bad.  We don't mistreat these phones at all - in fact, we hardly ever use them!  Motorolla & Nextel's warranty is also worthless - we have to pay to ship our phone's to Motorolla, and we don't get them back for 15 days!I am stuck with a 2 year contract with Nextel, the service has been horrible, and the i560 phones are lemons & junk!  I would NEVER buy a i560 phone again, or use NEXTEL - their service is terrible!  And yes, many times the person on the other end has terrible static and sounds garbled when talking (aka - drunk)"
Motorola i560 Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I bought this phone at the same time I bought the i870. I've dropped my i870 a couple of times and it's fine. My husband dropped the ""rugged"" phone once and the antenna, which sticks out like a thumb, snapped off. Nextel does not warrantee the phone unless you have their insurance plan, regardless of the advertising claims that this phone is durable to army standards. What army? DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! (unless of course, you also want to buy the insurance to replace it when it breaks in a few months"
Motorola i560 Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"Purchased this phone as an upgrade from the i530, which I loved. I was at the end of a 2 year contract, and felt that I would get something with a few more bells and whistles - and was excited about the color screen with the icons.  Two of my family members have higher end Nextels and all work well. I would have purchased one of those, except I didn't really care about a camera for my phone, and this one was reasonably priced...and I found out you get what you pay for!  The i560 felt almost cheap in construction compared to the i750, i870 and even my old i530.  I had it for a couple of weeks when I started having trouble with the clarity of my calls - I could hear them, but they couldn't hear me.  A couple of times, I had the screen go to Airplane Mode, even when I hadn't touched it.  The fact that you had to take the whole phone out to see who is calling was another downside, too.  My previous phone had to be flipped open to see who was calling, but I had a holster that could hold the phone without disengaging it.  Not a great design for this holster. Another problem is with the power supply. When charging the phone, it is especially important to make sure the plug is seated tight - and to check that is says device attached - it comes out easy and stops charging even when it appears to be plugged into the phone correctly. Then I am on a phone call on speakerphone and the whole speaker just stops working.  Living in California apparently gives us an advantage - 30 day risk free guarantee.  Fortunately, we were on day 12, and after 54 minutes, one accidental disconnection by Nextel and 6 customer service agents, I finally received a return authorization and placed a new order.  Terrible, terrible phone.  Stay away from it.  Hoping the new one on it's way works much better!Michell"
Motorola i560 Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I got this phone as part of a buy-one-get one free promotion. I changed from Cingular because I couldn't stand my bill being constantly wrong. The i560 seemed like a good choice at first. However, it is not as resilient as advertised. Within the first two months, my phone already malfunctioned. While talking to my wife on the phone, the phone went wacky and the pound sign appeared on my screen. Next, all I could hear was the sound of someone holding down a phone key. I was not even touching the phone. The phone did not respond to any keystrokes or even the command to turn off. Once I removed the battery and placed it back into the phone, the phone restarted and went directly into Airplane Mode. This is the most annyoing features of this phone and I wish you could disable it altogether. My wife's phone had to be replaced by the vendor where we got our phone. Mine is currently on its way to Motorola to be repaired. Caveat Emptor!"

palm Treo 680 PDA Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I was impatient to buy the successor of my beloved Treo 650, and did so last January by upgrading to the Treo 680. I have been a faithful customer of Palm technology since 1997, and for the first time, I am disappointed. Of course, I still have the friendly Palm OS, tailor made for smart phones. I also have upgrade compatibility for my 15,000 records stored in the Treo's four main applications. But the minuscule battery of the 680 forces me to curtail Versamail sync and phone conversations, and its clumsy command bar results in unexpected commands (contrary to the 650, buttons are too close to each other). Reliability of the 680 is also left to be desired, especially compared with the 650 after firmware update. Finally, I use Intellisync for dual sync with both user-friendly Palm Desktop and heavy duty email MS Outlook; the acquisition of Pumatech by Nokia results in a clumsy new release of Intellisync for Treo: Intellisync new version added a record number in the ""note"" field of all my records ! I quickly reverted to an older Intellisync version and I wonder what will happen when I need to upgrade with  MS Office 2007 compatibility... Nokia's low blow to Palm ? It is time Palm responds with a decent dual sync solution of their own. If not, it's decided: I will switch to the Pearl"
palm Treo 680 PDA Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"The good news is they fixed a lot of the things about the Treo 650's interface that were clunky, and it seems to crash less, but the battery life is significantly less than the 650 in my experience -- so much so, that I wish I had never ""upgraded"" to the 680."
palm Treo 680 PDA Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I 'upgraded' to this phone recently from a Treo 650 that had speaker and audio problems (don't all Treo 650's suffer from that within a year's usage?) and was already replaced once with a refurbished one that developed same problems. I loved my Treo 650 anyway so I expected something equivalent to the 650 but what I got was a 'smartphone' with quite a stupid battery life.  I have decided that there is definitely some glitch in design (some online geeks suggest it might actually be the SIM card) that is causing power to run right out of the phone, in a sharp decline, even when its not in use and all possible extraneous functions are disabled. Add to this the fact that Palm's website's online user group is not active right now (so no users can visibly discuss this among themselves),and you don't have to think too long to conclude that Palm knew this either beforehand or pretty quickly afterward, when they recently dumped this cheaper ""smartphone"" on the market recently.  Palm, all I can say is pretty ""stupid"" and wonder if this was your last hurrah before exiting the ""smartphone"" market? "
palm Treo 680 PDA Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I've used the Palm OS going on 10 years now.  When my Treo 270 died, I bought a used 270 on Ebay.  Eventually that one died too and I bought an unlocked 650 on Amazon.  I called Palm ""tech support"" on issues I had with it (dial up networking didn't work on internal browser with T-Mobile).  Forgive me for saying it, but the guy at Palm support was as dumb as dumb can be.  I got someone overseas who told me one inaccurate thing after another (he insisted that my Treo 270 never allowed dial up networking with the internal browser -even though I told him first hand that I used it all the time- did he think I was lying to him?).   He knew nothing about the phone and kept deferring to a supervisor, constantly keeping me on hold and it was just a huge waste of time.  After a few calls like this with no resolution I gave up and decided to return the 650.I then tried the T-Mobile MDA.  I was uneasy of the idea of switching to Windows PocketPC but decided to give it a try.  For me it was a huge mistake-  Pocket PC is a joke and completely unintuitive.  They expect you to study how to use their OS in order to make use of its clumsy interface.  Friends tell me they sell 3rd party applications that make it easier to use, but c'mon- when you buy a phone you expect it to work right from the beginning- I don't want to have to spend time learning and installing additional software for it to work properly.Finally, I give up on Pocket PC (sold it on Ebay) and give Palm another try when I see the 680 come out.  The dialup networking issue is no longer a problem on the 680 (as compared to the 650) and I buy it unlocked directly from Palm.  Overall, it's a decent phone and I just feel way more comfortable with Palm OS over Pocket PC.  Palm customer support is still useless and, as others have mentioned, the lack of a standard Mini-USB connector is simply inexcusable.  Still, I'm much happier with Palm-OS over Pocket PC.As I use it, I see that the battery doesn't seem to last very long (just over 2 hours of talktime at the most).  I hesitantly call Palm support and get some flunkie again-  I decide to cut my losses and stop wasting my time with their ""support"".  I'm just going to buy a second battery and second charger to keep the phone charged.  I hate the idea of making such a compromise, but for me it's the lesser of two evils.  The fact that Palm would release a phone with such terrible battery life is indicative of their customer mindset.  They just don't care.   As clunky as my Windows MDA was, its battery life was at least 3 to 4 times what the Treo gives me (even though the MDA has a much bigger screen).IMHO the Smartphone market is still going through growing pains-  The original Handspring Treo was designed by good people, when Palm bought them out they cashed in on the Treo product line but the customer oriented mentality of Handspring went right out the window -along with any intelligent design evolution of the Treo.  Most of the better designed smartphones on the market (Samsung, Motorola, HTC Wizard) are all made for Pocket PC because Microsoft has used it's clout to take over the market.  I just wish other manufacturers offered Palm-OS based smartphones again- this way you'd get the intuitive interface of Palm, without having to be limited to Palm's poorly designed hardware.....maybe it's time I finally give the Blackberry a try.... :"
T-Mobile Dash myFaves Smartphone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,I love the way the phone looks and feels but that's about it.  From finding contacts to dropped call this phone functions well below any phone I've ever owned.  I've had it now for 3 months and my frustration level continues to rise. 
T-Mobile Dash myFaves Smartphone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"First, let me say that I really wanted to like this device. I had patience and understanding for a while but it got me nowhere.The main issue with this phone is its operating system: Windows Mobile 5.0.This OS is a piece of fluff garbage. Simple things that should take a click or two have become so difficult to access that you basically just give up.Main Gripes-----------Connectivity with T-Mobile is horrible: accessing the aim function doesn't work 9 times out of 10. E-mail functions are useless. I tried finding a solution for hours and the best I got was having my email checked every hour but deleted shortly after that. Internet explorer can NEVER find the page that I'm looking for and consistently tells me to try again. Even when connected to wi-fi this happens. Let me tell you also that this device does not let you choose between wi-fi and edge. If you already opened IE and you were using EDGE then it will continue to use EDGE unless you restart the phone with wi-fi enabled.Calls-----Making a call was so difficult that I wanted to smash the phone on a daily basis. Usually, I would press talk to dial a call and it would immediately say ""Call Ended."" It's as if the device doesn't even want to try.Also, when answering a call, well trying to answer a call, it would drop it as soon as I pressed talk. What the HELL is THAT!? What good is a phone if you can't make or receive calls? Keep in mind this happens around half the time. Also keep in mind that I live in NEW YORK CITY! My calls should not be dropping except for when I'm in the subway. The side volume button is extremely annoying causing the volume to go to both extremes within one conversation. Not only that, but when you disable it, you have no other method of changing the volume on the device. ARGGGHHH!Keyboard-------While the keyboard is basically easy to type on, the phone is buggy. First off, the t9 sucks! It will completely change the word you are typing to a word that's in its dictionary while you're typing! EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING! Now get this, you can't even permanently keep the t9 off. So you have to keep going into the menu to change it to normal ABC mode. While I appreciate the ability to have faster typing, isn't the whole point of a QWERTY being able to type without using t9? When you actually get to typing, sometimes, the keys will ""stick"" and a character will continuously repeat until you stop it. This isn't a physical keyboard issue but yet another software issue.Programs-------For all you techno oriented people out there (basically everyone buying this phone), the programs this device has available for download are minuscule. Not only is the catalog of programs extremely limited but when using a JAVA program (which most programs are coded in) the Dash's JAVA program will not allow you to open those programs. I ALWAYS get an error stating ""A Java midlet is not responding"" It then gives me the choice of waiting or killing the app. Neither of which solve anything.This phone is so useless it's beyond words. I could go on and on about it's issues but I really don't care to.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE!While T-mobile customer support is very helpful and friendly, their service/coverage is non-existent. Calls are constantly dropped, I get voice mails without the phone even ringing, and internet connectivity is never really available.Please, do yourself a favor and wait for the iPhone."
T-Mobile Dash myFaves Smartphone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"In summary, Microsoft's software and T-Mobile's service have ruined a brilliant design (although with a couple of flaws) from HTC.There are many pros and cons about this device and the service that it is shackled to.  I will break it down to Hardware, Software and Cell Phone Service Provider.Hardware Pro's:A lot has been written about this aspect of the device, so I'll keep this to a minimum - The best form factor I've ever seen.  This device provides you the power of a Blackberry without the bulky hardware so I can put it in my pocket comfortably and not have to look like a geek with the belt holster.- A key selling point for me was the combined Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and quad-band connectivity that enabled me to connect a wireless headset, cruise web pages and have access to email when in the US or Europe.- The phone quality is excellent.- The keyboard layout is excellent and easy to use for medium sized emails.- The battery life is great when Wi-Fi is not enabled and adequate when it is. (I've rarely struggled with a dying battery.)  Stand-by power management appears to be excellent.- Charging of the device is very quick.- The display, while a little small, is crystal clear and surprisingly easy to use given its size.- The camera is pretty good and it's been really great emailing photo's to people as I'm traveling around.[After all of the cons that you'll read below you'll wonder why I ever bought the device and why I still use it.  Well here it is:1. T-Mobile locked me into a 2 year contract on a very expensive device.2. It has great hardware that I can use in the US and Europe, I'm just hoping that Microsoft will finally get it right. ]Hardware Con's- The touch sensitive volume button is the most ill-conceived feature I've ever seen.  Even after playing around with various settings it is still hard to quickly set the volume at the desired level.  Even worse, when using the phone your ear or finger can inadvertently hit the control and randomly change the volume.- The TI OMAP 850 at 201MHz is not beefy enough for the software that is loaded onto the device.  However, the blame could well be laid at Microsoft's door for writing inefficient code and having poor scheduling software between tasks and applications.  Either way, performance is very slow for some basic functions (see below) and I'm afraid some of the blame needs to be laid at the choice of processor.Software Pro's- Not many that really come to mind.Software Con's (I hope you're sitting comfortably)- When a call is on call waiting the phone fails to give an option to the user to select which call to take and which call to put on hold or drop/ignore.  On the occasions this problem has occurred with me the call that is dropped/kept appears random with a preference to switch to the incoming call no matter what is depressed.  The other call is dropped and not put on hold.- When a call is incoming and the keyboard is locked, if the user depresses the green phone key the call is dropped.  This is extremely counter intuitive.  If the user presses anything other than the ""answer"" key the call is dropped and sometimes the call has been dropped even when I have depressed the ""answer"" key.- The contacts database is extremely rudimentary with a very limited number of views and filters that can be used.  Even worse, upon selection, the contacts database takes between 5 and 8 seconds to open.  Now, I have what some would call a large database of contacts, but considering that the Palm OS version responded immediately with a far more sophisticated use model this excuse does not wash.  It's simply a poorly architected database.- The user interface for entering a new contact is rudimentary (as are all dialog windows on this device.)- One of the most annoying aspects of this device is the alarm clock.  The user interface looks like it was written in 10 minutes and was clearly not verified for correctness.  The digital watch I had in 1982 had the same degree of sophistication but with a more intuitive use model and was more thoroughly debugged. First of all, the user only gets to select a time and if the alarm is on or off.  From the interface you would assume you could only set a single alarm....if only it were that obvious.  The best way to explain this buggy piece of software is with an example: I set the alarm for 6am; the next day the alarm goes off at 6am.  That day I set the alarm for 7am - the following day the alarm goes off at 6am and 7am.  The next day I set the alarm for 7:30am and you guessed it, the alarm now goes off three times.  The best that I've been able to deduce (of course, this type of behavior is not documented in the user manual that comes with the device) is that the user has to actively select ""off"" for the current setting before setting ""on"" for the new time.  But there is no indication of what alarms are set, so after a while or a particularly busy week you can loose track of what's set and what isn't....the only way to clear all of the alarms that have been set is a hard re-boot.- The calculator is a joke.  If this took an engineer 10 minutes to write they should be fired.  A calculator watch in the '80's had more sophisticated features.  The user interface is so bad it's hard to describe it in words. - Microsoft truly does not understand how a user would like to use the device and instead insists on using the same usage model that they've inflicted upon us since Windows 95.  Most features or function have to be navigated through the Start menu button.  Applications are nested and features are hidden behind several annoying menu selections.  Some features are simply hard to find, but should it really take so many menu selections to find common tools or applications?- The use of alarms or reminders is ambiguous - to put the device in ""Silent"" mode, but leave alarms on because you want to sleep and only want your alarm to wake you up, for example, does not work.  Calendar reminders will be active as they are assigned the alarm property instead of their own or the notification property.  The only way around this is to cancel reminders for all day events....otherwise you get an alarm at midnight.- So, on my Nokia phone a thousand years ago, when I went to Europe my phone would have a simple selection for the new frequency I needed once landed.  The phone would then automatically connect to the provider available.  It wasn't completely automatic, but the user interaction was simple and intuitive.  Not with the Dash.  First of all T-Mobile doesn't help by keeping a radio button on your online account that you have to select to enable international roaming.  The feature is free so why not add a selection anyway?  All you know when you get to your destination is that your phone won't connect to the local network no matter what you do.  Now, assuming that you worked this out, you are now faced with the challenge of actually connecting to the local provider's network.  On my Blackberry this was automatic, but of course with Microsoft there are selections to make, searches to activate and various other contortions that need to be gone through before you connect to the provider of choice.  Assuming that you get connected at all.- ActiveSync: This is the most annoying piece of software in that it just does not work.  Worse still, when it does not work it gives a cryptic error message stating that an error has occurred and some data will be lost next time you perform synchronization.  It does not provide you with a fix, a hint or a path so that you don't lose data.  It does not even tell you the data that was lost.  So, I'm using a Microsoft Mobile OS with Microsoft XP and Microsoft Outlook and they can't get that right?  (OK, it maybe serves me right for signing up to so much Microsoft, but come on.)  This was another primary purchasing driver for me.  I am very busy and want to have my schedule up to date between my PC and PDA - all the time.  It's the only way to keep organized.  I thought that with the same provider of all the software I'd be OK.  Also, as this feature has been around for over a decade from Palm and perfected by Blackberry....how hard can it be?There are probably annoying nits that I have with the software, but those are the major ones.  And they are major.Considering this is Windows Mobile 5.0 what on earth were they doing for 1.0, 2.0, etc.?Service Provider Pro- T-Mobile is useful to me for traveling in Europe.  They have much better coverage over there than in the US (where I'm actually paying).- Their package is competitive.Service Provider Con:- Coverage is not good enough.  I'm in San Francisco and I have dead spots in my house.- Their back-end connectivity with your email providers is terribly buggy.  At random times you will get cryptic messages saying that you must have something wrong with your connection and emails can't be accessed.  But you know there's nothing wrong with your connection because you've been on the browser.  Also, there was a whole day that emails were not accessible.  Because of the many issues that I'd had with email set up and maintaining a connection I went through various debug routines wondering what had failed.  When I finally called technical support they told me that their service was down - no apology, no notification, no nothing.  Certainly no minutes to make up for the inconvenience.  (So, why didn't I call technical support earlier?  read below...)- Their technical support structure is terrible.  I have collectively wasted over 12 hours of my life on their ""help"" line.  I'm not going to go into details as it would just take too long.  Bottom line, if you have a problem with your phone say ""Dash"" at the prompt and then ask for Tier Three Data support.  Everything you get before that is a waste of your time as the technicians you'll encounter have inadequate training.  If you are then put on hold and are given another number to dial - DO NOT DO IT - This cycles you back around to Tier Two Data Support and you have to go back to the back of the line for someone that understands the device.So, should you buy it?  Wait until Windows Mobile 6.0 comes out at least.     Maybe another provider will pick up the device by that time. Then see what else is available"
T-Mobile Dash myFaves Smartphone (T-Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"My phone broke after a month or so.  After spending 30 minutes on the phone during which time t-mobile continually wanted to blame me (did you put it in fluorescent light, did you put it in the sun, did you drop it, did you put it in your pocket and bend it, did you put it in your pocket and bump into something, did you drop it, did you break it, did you do something bad to it) they finally relented and agreed to send a new one with the oft repeated comment that if they determined that the phone was damaged then they would charge me untold sums of money.The most amusing part of the conversation went like this:  would you like UPS ground which will take 10 days or UPS 3 day which will cost $15?  When I responded that the ground would be fine she said ""OK, that will be $9.95"".  I had to laugh at their arrogance."

Bluetooth USB Dongle/ Adapter - 100 Meters Blue (Retail Package): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I encourage many to stay away from this usb product; like previous reviewers said, just spend the extra money on a better usb dongle. As soon as i got this thing out of its package, i almost snapped the casing off due to its poor construction.  The main problem that i have experienced with this product is that although its range is ok(not the 100 meters that it claims), as soon as i go into a room thats only 10 feet away, has doors or walls in the way, the reception starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes."
Bluetooth USB Dongle/ Adapter - 100 Meters Blue (Retail Package): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"This item was an absolute waste of money and I'm all the more irritated for having purchased it.  Upon attempting to merely insert the device, the outer case of the dongle split open.  What I discovered?  That cute little 'antenna' doesn't actually connect to anything!  It's just a piece of plastic that hangs off the side!When I finally managed to get the damn thing running (the installation was completely unintuitive and required repeatedly attempting the same actions to so much as pair/connect a device) it worked fine - once.  I turned off my laptop, removed the dongle, and was amazed to discover that subsequently my computer failed to recognize the device at all.Do yourself a favor.

Motorola KRZR K1 Phone (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,The KRZR is a really cool looking phone - but it has 2 huge issues - a very short battery life (1 day) and sllloooowwww reaction time - push the menu key and WAIT for it to come up.I would explore other options
Motorola KRZR K1 Phone (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"After reading the numerous positive reviews for this phone, I purchased.  Here are the main issues I have found with this phone:  1) The buttons are too small, particularly the main control button.  You have to used the side of your fingers to ensure that you do not hit too buttons at the same time. And, believe me, I do not have very large hands.  2) If you have quite a few contacts in your phone, you will be irritated by the delay when you scroll down quickly to select a contact.  You will notice that if you are not careful, you will dial the wrong contact due to the delay when scrolling and selecting quickly, so if this is you, be aware.  3) You must open the cover and look inside to see if you have missed a call or have a message.  VERY INCONVENIENT!!  There is no indication to show this on the top screen, only the inside screen.  4) On occasion, the display on the outside of the phone stops working entirely.  What you just need to do is power the phone down and they back up again.  Not optimal, and I probably just got a bad phone, but I am just waiting for the situation to get more frequent, so I can then deal with the likely nightmare of having to get a replacement phone from Motorola.  NOTE:  I have no personal vendetta against Motorola, but wanted to provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuff I bought into before purchasing"

Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"i think that logitech make the best accessories.  I have the camera, the fancy DiNovo bluetooth keyoard..... so naturally this headset was a no brainer.  The reason i got it was to use it with my computer setup as opposed to looking like a dork walking around in public.It worked on my dell 9200 laptop fine with skype however it did not work with my dell 8400 desktop using the Logitech Bluetooh hub.  Don't you find that strange?  Aside from that, it also did not work with my sony ericsson phone (can't remember the model).  In addition, it really hurts my ears.. not the most comfortable.... so you decide if this product works for you."
Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"This headset has a major flaw - the connections between the headset and phone are full of static.  The other parties don't hear it, but their voice is  constantly zapped by the static, and I'm asking them to repeat themselves. I've compared it with a couple other headsets I've got, and they don't have this problem in the same locations.  Actually, this headset has static problems ANYWHERE - office, car, out walking, you name it.Do yourself a favor and avoid this one"
Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I've used the headset for a little over a year and, although plagued with disconnects when idle, was relatively pleased with the sound quality. Not being connected when calls came in was a major annoyance. There was no notice when it disconnected. Recently the plastic ear clip broke and I contacted Logitech and was informed that,since it was over the one year warranty, my only option would be to purchase a new headset; a huge price to pay for a piece that costs pennies.Logitech's concern for its customers appears to be nonexistant"
Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I originally purchased the Logitech Mobile Freedom headset but when the clip that goes behind your ear broke, Logitech exchanged it for the Mobile Traveller. Unfortunately, this one is not comfortable at all. I agree with others that after 30-45 minutes, it feels like your ear is in a vise. It's true. It hurts.Sound quality is very good. People say they can hear me just fine, and I can hear them just fine.But it also disconnects with my cell phone when it is not in use. What good is that? Then when the phone rings, I don't hear it. Then the clip broke on this one as well. Logitech again replaced it. But how long will this one lsat? Do yourself a favor and skip this one"
Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,This headset is uncomfortable to wear but if you heat the earpiece and bend it outwards and back it will fit just fine. You can also go to an eyewear store and have them do it for you.As for the performance it is great. I drive truck and have a lot of background noise and windows are usually down partially and everyone has no problems hearing and understanding me and I can hear them just fine also. The volume is great and at times I have to turn it down in volume. Have tried the AnycomHS-890 and this outperforms it hands down. Have had it drop my phone on occasion but never during a call where the Anycom would at any time. I would definitely  reccommend this headset to anyone in a noisy environment. Very satisified with the performance. Tried to change the rating and seems like can't do that once the review is written. Amazon needs to fix the edit system on this
Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset: Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I've had two of these.  Both sounded and worked well for a few months.  then the piece that goes over the ear and is described as too tight broke completely off of the first unit and snapped in two places on the second.  When this happens, you're perfectly operating  earpiece becomes a bad piece of geek jewlery.  While it's perfmance was good before the break, the use of heap plastic under the rubberized piece instead of a small piece of ""memory titanum"" or something better renders this thing to the level of toxic waste (battery contains lithium I bet)   Skip by this one if you're smart.  I've been had twice"

Motorola RAZR V3 Mauve Phone (Unlocked): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I ordered a Motorola RAZR V3 Mauve Phone (Unlocked)a month ago. I was hoping to get the color that I saw on the web page...and that's where the problem lies. The image shown is completely misleading.The phone that I received, was mauve but a different one from the picture shown on the Amazon web site.The mauve phone that I got was a grayish dull mauve and not the pretty pinkish mauve as advertised. Also,the phone had 2 different color tones. At night/in the lighting at night, the top part of the phone(the part that flips open) and its corresponding part at the back of the phone looks completely gray.Needless to say, I spoke to customer service and sent the phone back for an exchange.I didn't have to pay the shipping charges. The 2nd phone that came had the same color problem again, so for the 2nd time I returned it and got my money refunded.I gave 1 star due to the customer service provided, but again they could not help me. Some one said it could be an item with a defect....but for methe whole experience was  disappointing.If you are ready to spend so much on this phone its because of the brand, and the 'color' which you will never get because Amazon has put the wrong image on the web page...very misleading and wrong to all the customers.Incidentally, this color as seen is offered by Verizon and they call it 'pink', but Amazon calls it 'mauve',though the phone and the image shown do not match. So stay away from ordering this pretty mauve phone...all you will get is loads of disappointment with your time being wasted."

BlackBerry 8100c Pearl (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"The phone is great .. and I knew it would be.  And I am a devoted Amazon shopper.  My concern was always whether Amazon was up to the daunting task of selling cell phones and service plans ... a concern that has proved well founded.I was originally concerned because of feedback I had read on this site indicating the Pearl ""shipped hot,"" with an active SIM, which meant for those that -- like me - were upgrading (vs. new service), their existing phone would stop working while the new phone was en route.  To be fair, that did NOT happen; however, I received the Pearl with a SIM card that the phone would not accept.The instructions that are sent with the phone say that all you have to do is insert the SIM, turn on the phone, and it will work.  And, if it doesn't work, it says, don't call Cingular, call Amazon.  I followed the instructions -- phone didn't work, I called Amazon, at which point the CSR told me that he had all my information and someone would be contacting me in 48 HOURS!!!Unfortunately, I let the poor guy have it ... I told him what I truly believe, which is that it is COMPLETELY unacceptable to tell me I have to wait 2 days just to talk to someone about why my phone - which is supposed to work out of the box -- isn't working.So - 5 Stars for the phone itself ... awesome!  2 stars for Amazon ... they do NOT have the kinks worked out yet.

Audiovox 8610 Vox Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"My old Audiovox phone, the 8500 was great. It fell in the toilet, though, and they didn't sell them anymore at the Virgin webstore, so I bought the 8610 at a local Sprint store. What a big mistake. It is awful with the poor sound quality, short battery life, horrible ringtones, and worst of all, I was unable to ever retrieve my voicemail! Hello? and it has the most horrible graphics. Does anyone want to buy it, along with all the accessories?? It is barely used...So I looked on Ebay and found a used 8500 and bid on it, won it, and now I am happy again as it is far superior to the 8610. I like the 8500s micro-size, simplicity, ringtones, animated graphics, etc. I must be careful not to lose it, or drop it in the toilet again, though. My 8500 was replaced last year when I lost the first one, but I cannot get another replacement as I bought this one used.The pay as you go works fine for me as I do not want to have a cell phone clued to my head. I use it to check my land line for messages and for brief calls. Do not buy the 8610, whatever you do"
Audiovox 8610 Vox Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"This review is more about Virgin Mobil customer service than the phone. I ordered a VOX 8610 on 1/22/2007 online thru Virgin Mobile. The phone wouldn't charge. I called customer service and explained the problem. They said did I want a charger or another phone. I replied that I could not tell if it was the charger or the phone that was at fault so please send a new kit.  I received a phone but not a charger and it also wouldn't charge. I called customer service and explained the issue and it must be the charger at fault. The rep said they would not send a new charger, that I would have to purchase one.  I said this didn't make any sense, according to the offer I could return the phone for a full refund and does that mean that to get a new phone and charge  I need to return the phones for a refund and then order another one to get a charger?  The support rep said yes and that I had to make up my mind - either return the phone or purchase a charger.  I asked to speak to a supervisor. The customer support rep kept going off line (to talk to someone?) but refused or couldn't get a supervisor to talk to me.  She then asked for the ESN number of the phone. When I said I didn't know what an 'ESN' number she indignantly explained that it was like a serial number on the back of the phone. I'm not clear why she needed this, since I haven't activated the phone and I already referenced the order (vmu) number.  At any rate I had been on the phone now for over 40 min with the support rep (obviously not very cost effective for virgin mobile) and  at least she was trying to track down some info - or so I thought - she finally came back on line and said that the computer was down and she couldn't handle my order - that I would have to call back.  I called back, had to work my way thru the answering system and got thru to RMA and a fellow named Mike.  Mike  explained that they couldn't send a charger (none in stock) and that I would have to send the entire phone back - which is what I am now doing - 60+ minutes after the initial call. I have to say that my interactions with virgin mobile so far has not been positive. They customer service staff is  obviously  poorly trained and not empowered to make decisions.  The interfaces with support are youth geared - not a bad thing except when it is at the expense of treating adults courteously and professionally.  I am sending the phone back for a refund and re-considering the provider for pay-as-you-go service.   01/26/2007."
Audiovox 8610 Vox Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I have had this phone for about six months.  I replaced a Kyocera that I disliked because it was so big, but the size of this phone does not begin to make up for its problems.  The menus are very poorly designed, they are difficult to navigate and it's hard to do anything.  The ringer speaker is inside the phone, so when it's closed, it's almost impossible to hear.  I almost never hear it ring.  I usually keep it in my pocket with the vibrate turned on, but if you turn the phone off, the vibrate gets turned off, so you have to remember to turn that back on!  I hate this phone, and will be replacing it soon."
Audiovox 8610 Vox Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,2.0," I reluctantly bought this phone because my Kyocera Slider suddenly died on me conveniently 3 months after VM's warranty was up and i had just purchased a $20 phone card + had airtime credits which were not refundable.  Now i am not a teen and my phone and things do not receive harsh treatment.My kyocera slider actually looked like new when it died with no scratches what-so-ever so i was pretty upset.After multiple calls and 2 emails to VM it was pretty clear they weren't going to do anything to help.      I was offered a replacement slider at $20.Obviously I didn't want the same one that could possibly die on me after a couple of months so like i was saying I had no other recourse but to purchase this Audiovox 8610.By the way AFTER I PURCHASED THE PHONE AT A LOCAL STORE IN TOWN (when i called to activate the phone)they have the nerve to tell me that I could've purchased the same 8610 from them at a discount price of $24.99 because the slider died.The f!@%ng idiots!HELLO COULD YA NOT HAVE TOLD ME SOONER???and after i spent $50 + tax.sheesh!  Anyway back to the phone review..the ringer is indeed low as others have reported here.Its so low that if its in my purse i can't even hear it! WTF??? Also the battery life sucks, no sooner does the thing ring and the batteries at half.It also doesnt get good service with the VM/Sprint network, my slider had xcellent service w/it despite everything and rarely if ever dropped calls.      So I've had it 5 days and I'm considering attempting to bring it back where I purchased it from.However i don't want to buy an expensive phone from VM because I'm seriously reconsidering continuing w/them.  The way I see it VM leaves alot to be desired with the quality of phones they sell + they are expensive.I am a lite user but if you talk slightly more than usual you end up feeling it wallet- wise.Prior to these issues I was a happy VM customer but not anymore.

Kyocera switch_back Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,The phone may be fine but I will never know because my Virgin Mobile service never really worked. Perhaps it was the phones fault I never received text messages even though they were being deducted from my account. Overall their customer service is AWFUL. Days of waiting and receiving no information. I had to file 4 investigations because they would close them without resolving the issue or they were not filled out right. I spent hours on the phone with them and never had the problem fixed. Now I have thrown away a bunch of money for crappy service. I plan to just run out the minutes and then disconnect the phone. Its garbage.I went with the T-Mobile Sidekick and already am way happier
Kyocera switch_back Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"This phone could quite possibly be the biggest piece of technology crap.

Samsung Blackjack Smartphone (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I've had this thing for two weeks.  Coming from the Blackberry 8700c, this phone is a big disappointment.  Work issued this and took away the Blackberry and I'm stuck with it.  All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes. The more I use the thing the less I like it.  Here's my list, good and bad.* Battery life - attrocious.  Use the extended battery, throw away the standard one.  Trust me.  Grade: D.* Navigation - cumbersome.  The keys are too small, the 5-way nav with buttons get pressed accidentally.  Workable if you don't have huge hands.  Grade: B* Windows Mobile - I hate it.  Why do applications not quit when you end them?  Instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the task manager.  The menu is pre-loaded with goodies to buy from Cingular, how convenient.  Grade: C+ if you bother to learn the shortcut keys.* Java is broken, Google email doesn't work.  Maps DOES work with the new version, thankfully.  Grade: C.* No standard headphone jack.  HELLO??  This is suppose to be an MP3 player, right?  Somebody explain to me why this is OK.  Grade: F.* Phone quality - Grade A.  Yes, they did something right.  The phone works great, reception is great, speakerphone is great.  Bluetooth is great. * Outlook & email - This is workable, but difficult.  You can write an email, you can edit your schedule and tasks, but it's not easy.  If Blackberry gets and ""A"" (and it does), Blackjack gets a C.  It doesn't synch notes, so if you're an Outlook Notes person you're just left out, sorry.  Why??* Hardware quality - Very good, B+.  The thing really feels solidly built.  The screen is vibrant and attractive.  The camera seems to work fine, although I may use it twice per year.In short, if you really want to get work done on your phone get a Blackberry.  If you want a phone that does a lot of things poorly but looks nice, this could be the one for you."
Samsung Blackjack Smartphone (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"After owning 3 Blackberry's over the years, I made the switch to the BlackJack because of the camera and the ability to add memory. Compared to the Blackberry, the Microsoft operating system is very cumbersome (for me) and was somewhat frustrating to set up initially. On the plus side, the Blackjack has good battery life, the screen is excellent and it has the best reception I've ever experienced. The reason I only gave the phone 2 stars is because after just 3 months of moderate use the ink (ie: the numbers) began wearing off the keys. It's to the point now where the phone is pretty much unusable, especially when it's backlit. I called Cingular first, who passed me on the Samsung where, after 2 hours on the phone, I was told that my only option was to send the phone (my primary source of communication) to their service center and wait 3 weeks. To my surprise, they went on to say that, at their discretion, they might also charge me for the repair. I've read comments on these reviews were people complained about service and I always just assumed they were exaggerating but now that I've encountered this, I do feel it's worth considering. If you're thinking about a Blackjack, I encourage you to be aware that, for one, the ink may inexplicably wear off the keys, and, that you may well be on your own when it comes to service. I feel that it's reasonable to expect a device as expensive as this to remain functional for at least 3 months and if not, the company who sold it should assume responsibility for making it right."

Cingular 8525 Desktop Cradle (With Spare Battery Charger): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I bought this because my 8525 eats batteries and it's nice to have one charging while I'm using the other--you don't have to be tied to a wire to charge your phone.  So I also bought one of Boxwave's batteries for the 8525.Well, the spare battery charger will charge the Boxwave battery just fine, but it refuses to charge the battery that came with my 8525.  This really limits its usability as an off-line charging device.The cradle itself plugs into the USB port on the phone, which was not designed with cradling in mind, so it's not easy to get the thing lined up to use as an actual cradle.  Since the camera button is on the bottom of the phone (who's idea was that anyway?) it almost always gets pressed while I'm wiggling the phone in or out of the cradle.  This is just a bit of nuisance it just means you have to quit the camera application every time you put it in or take it out of the docking station.Anyway, just my opinion, but it's actually easier to connect the standard USB charger to the phone than it is to put it in the cradle, so I'd recommend save your money and just sticking with the standard USB charger.If you really want to do all charging off-line you may need to buy two Boxwave batteries instead of just one"

These styluses do not fit into their slot properly leaving the head sticking out further than the manufacturer designed.

In order to fit anyone but a newborn I had to pull the earpieces apart, which could have broken the wires if I weren't careful, and may tear further through wearing it. The mike is located symmetrically from both earpieces; this means that the mike is lodged at my addams apple. There are several places which I'm worried will break soon through normal wear and tear. The ear pieces are hard plastic, and look like they'll be uncomfortable if worn for a long time. The reason I needed stereo headsets in the first place was to listen to music.

palm Treo 680 Smartphone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I have owned Palm organizers since the days of the original Palm Pilot and have loved them (I think I had three different models over the years). I wanted a smart phone so I could check my email so I gravitated to the Treo 680 so I could stay with a Palm product and so I could stay with my current mobile provider, Cingular. Now I am counting the days until my 2 year commitment ends so I can punt this awful, awful product. I may even bite the bullet and pay off my commitment early just so I can get rid of it.The battery problem is huge. You must remember to stick this in a charger whenever you can. If you forget and leave it in your pocket overnight then it will be dead the next day. I have turned off every thing I can find that sucks power and it still drains amazingly fast. It won't even last a day if you make very many calls.The reception is terrible. I've had a Cingular phone for a long time and was able to get good reception over most of So. California (except for my house of course). With this phone I think you have to be right underneath an antenna to get a signal. I was on a conference call yesterday and got dropped twice. I am envious everytime I get in an elevator with someone who can talk on their cell phone because mine will freeze up any time I try that. Yes, it freezes up often. The only way I have found to unfreeze it is to take out the battery and let it do a hard reboot.The versa mail program that it came with from Cingular is hard to work with. You must leave your work computer on to check the corporate mail. That means if I am traveling with my computer, the phone's corporate mail program will not work. It often will not sync anyway. I don't think the browser that comes with the phone will work with Java, so I cannot check my Yahoo mail either. I tried going back and forth to the pre-Java version of Yahoo and that is too much of a pain.I get all kinds of weird messages with the phone. I haven't ever been able to sync up the Palm features because of some legacy files from my previus palm software, something that never happened when I upgraded before.Yes, there is a manual that is huge. It is hard to use on line so I guess I need to bite the bullet and print out the whole thing and then take a week of vacation to read it and see if I can make any of these neat functions that I read about work.Hardly a week goes by that I don't actively think how much I hate this phone. I actually signed on to Amazon today just to write this because the phone wasn't working properly today. What a piece of junk!"
palm Treo 680 Smartphone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,Palm could not resolve all the issues associated with Treo. I bought this phone few days back and it freezes frequently.
palm Treo 680 Smartphone (Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I've had the same problem other users are having with the losing signal and never finding it again with Cingular.  I've gone through 4 phones - the same thing over and over.  Never did they (or I) put 2 and 2 together to see that it was the SD card (although right now it's working, and the card is not in it - go figure!).  So, I guess the options are not download things, but have the phone work, or download things onto my SD card, and not have a phone"

palm Treo 750 Smartphone (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,"I have a 650 with a cell number that has been with me for over 10 years. Perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price, I thought my fulfilled contract (I am on month to month now) meant I could qualify for a ""new account"" and keep my number. No such luck. After wasting a few hours dealing with Cingular and then someone in India on behalf of Wirefly, I had to return it. It is ironic that someone who has never had a cell phone can get a price 75% lower than a loyal 13 year customer! I will take the next carrier that offers a reasonable price on a 700 even though I would prefer the 750"
palm Treo 750 Smartphone (at&t/Cingular): Cell Phones & Service,1.0,I ordered this phone on 3/28/07. It shipped via FEDEX on 3/29/07 to my office with an indicated delivery of 3/2/07. The package sat on the FEDEX truck for three days before they attempted to deliver it at 8pm to an adjacent business and then left it without the package being signed for. This was after I'd already called FEDEX to refuse delivery of the package because it was too late in arriving.  FEDEX's response for it sitting three days on the delivery truck was that the driver was overloaded.  For the $100 difference in price it was less hassle to just go to the local Cingular store.

Motorola i760 Phone (Nextel): Cell Phones & Service,2.0,"I got rid of the bulky i355s at the end of our contract and bought two of these for our account.  We had to return the first phone (line1) within days of getting it as it would randomly shut off (crash), and other times the volume would fluctuate on its own.  Exchanging it was an ordeal with Sprint - they charged me for the replacement phone and still haven't credited my account after two billing cycles.  A few months later and now the second phone (line2) is crashing.  I'll make a call and hang up - and it shuts off.  Other times it will shut off in the middle of the call.  The other night I went to charge it and it said invalid battery - so I took the battery out and put it back in.  Then it said ""invalid charger.""  I might go back to the i355, it was rugged, reliable (but large) phone.  I guess I'll have to haggle with Motorola about getting this one fixed/replaced"
